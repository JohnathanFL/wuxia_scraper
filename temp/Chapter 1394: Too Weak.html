Keep running your mouth and the wind might cut off your tongue!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye casually smiled in response: “There’s practically no difference since no one dares to ascend to the throne before me! In the current generation, even if I have yet to ascend, gods will still have to obediently stand to the side.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This casual yet domineering remark made everyone gasp! Who would dare to utter such words? Perhaps even Meng Zhentian wouldn’t dare to do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such a big tone!” Daoist Lin revealed a dark smile: “Your thick skin is definitely unmatched. I suppose when there is no tax, people can run their mouths all they want. You need to show your true abilities in order to convince people.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“True abilities? You and the yang brat can come together, I’ll take your heads in three to five moves.” Li Qiye spoke in a carefree manner without a care for Lin’s mockery.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two turned quite unsightly after hearing this. Their initial feud worsened since even a statue would become angry after receiving such blatant humiliation!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li, I know you are strong, but we can handle five moves.” The Extreme Yang Monarch was furious. They were both rulers of their respective domains. If they couldn’t handle a couple of moves, there was no need for them to show themselves in public any longer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, watch how I’ll take you down within five moves.” Li Qiye was too lazy to care about the current situation. He didn’t even want to look at Meng Zhentian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoist Lin stood out with the monarch and shouted: “Fine! Li Qiye, we’ll settle this with three moves.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He simply didn’t believe that Li Qiye could kill them with so few moves since they still had powerful cards up their sleeves.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” Both of their blood energies soared without holding anything back. They assumed their peak battle state. Lin’s body emitted a holy light just like a blooming lotus while the monarch’s fire ignited. He became a sun that emitted a terrifying temperature, forcing people to retreat.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” At this time, both of them took out their weapons. One was an imperial weapon while the other was an artifact from a grand completion Immortal Physique user.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Both attacked at the same time with their strongest move.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The entire continent trembled in the face of their attacks. The monarch’s move looked like a gigantic fire dragon soaring forward. It carried a monstrous rage that could incinerate deities.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people palpitated from its furious roars and maintained a safe distance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoist Lin’s weapon echoed as well. Numerous holy rays descended from the sky as if they were judging Li Qiye. These rays wished to disintegrate him as they engulfed his body and laws.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monarch cultivated the Extreme Yang Physique while Lin had the Void Imperfection Physique. Their combined attack was indeed powerful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, these two weren’t weak at all. Alas, they were utterly defeated several days ago by Puresun, so it gave the misconception that they were insignificant and weak. In actuality, Puresun was simply too strong. At his current power, few Godkings from the previous generation would be able to contend against him or force him to unsheathe his sword. Those who could fight him might have to be at Meng Zhentian’s level.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of the crowd skipped a beat after seeing this display of strength. They were indeed talented prodigies despite not being a match for Puresun!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye in the face of this incoming attack. In an instant, his body lit up with all four Immortal Physiques at the same time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just imagine the outcome of all four physiques erupting together! Infinite weight, infinite power, infinite speed, and infinite evasion! All other offensive and defensive means became meaningless. Even the strongest attack wouldn’t be a match for their combined might and the strongest defense would be as vulnerable as a piece of paper.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Crack!” A bang was followed by bone-cracking noises. Two bodies flew across the sky while vomiting blood before loudly slamming into the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Lin and the monarch were lying on the ground as their blood slowly dripped down. They couldn’t stand up even with their weapons supporting them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye was too fast and powerful. If their weapons didn’t protect them in the split second before impact, they would be long gone by now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye’s physiques had yet to reach grand completion, but his mastery meant that it wasn’t far from achieving this level!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Zhentian raised his brows after seeing Li Qiye in action. His combination of physiques was too fast, even Zhentian couldn’t see through the secrets right away. Suddenly, Zhentian had an ominous feeling that he couldn’t clearly describe.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene turned quiet right away as everyone took in a deep breath. If Zhentian couldn’t figure it out, then others would naturally be even more confused.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoist Puresun was also startled. He became suspicious about Li Qiye cultivating multiple Immortal Physiques. However, he didn’t dare to confirm this conjecture right now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectating experts glanced at each other in astonishment. No one thought that these two working together wouldn’t even be able to block a single blow from Li Qiye. This was a heaven-defying might beyond their comprehension. Prior to this, some were unhappy while others even felt hatred towards him. But now, these people were trembling inside and didn’t dare to show disrespect. This was especially true for the charming spirits.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye’s move just now was a great deterrent!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Too weak.” Li Qiye flatly said this without a care. His nonchalant appearance made everyone speechless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering in the octagonal tower, his cultivation became even stronger than before. He had embarked on the path of the heavens while his grand dao moved beyond its initial form.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, he could have entered the heavenly path long ago, but he was purposely suppressing his cultivation because his grand dao wasn’t complete.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After learning the Grand Primordial Dao — the innate gift of the Kun Peng, Li Qiye finally took the first step in forming his dao! This improved his cultivation by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words “too weak” weren’t appropriate to describe Daoist Lin and the monarch. If they were too weak, then the other cultivators here shouldn’t even show their faces. Alas, no one dared to speak up against Li Qiye. This was the moment when the crowd finally realized that Li Qiye was qualified to compete against Zhentian!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, some charming spirits secretly belittled Li Qiye and thought that he used unorthodox and heretical methods. But now, such statements were found to be baseless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Profound slightly frowned as well. Despite him disliking Li Qiye, he had to admit that Li Qiye was very powerful. After seeing him in action, Profound felt a chill inside. Li Qiye’s strength has exceeded his imagination once more.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puresun was the only one who stayed calm. As he had said before after seeing Li Qiye exit the octagonal tower, no one in the contemporary was a match for Li Qiye!</span></p>
