Does the world really have such an immortal beast?” A few juniors stared in awe at the escaping beast carrying Hai Lin.

With such powerful creatures protecting him, he could have become emperor if it wasn’t for Aotian.” Another expert said with envy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This golden dragon is his senior with a prestigious position and a noble bloodline.” A demon ancestor said with emotions: “This golden dragon can definitely assail an emperor yet it is still not enough to face Aotian.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While people were in awe of the dragon, Li Qiye was amused at their opinion.

When people talked about dragons, even flood-dragons were considered ordinary dragons. Some with shallow knowledge even considered dao serpents to be dragons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in the eyes of real dragons, only those with the real ancient bloodline of the divine beast were considered dragons. This bloodline must be pure as well, not the thin one coursing through the veins of the many bastards.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, real dragons looked down on the serpents and flood-dragons that claimed to be part of their race.

Normally, one could be a dragon with enough inherited blood of a True Dragon. Of course, derision and scorn would come from creatures with thin bloodline claiming to be dragons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for this golden dragon ahead, it had one-third of a True Dragon Bloodline. This was the reason why its body was so resplendent and its draconic aura powerful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A matured Golden Dragon can indeed assail an emperor. However, it still wasn’t a True Dragon, only a side branch. Its blood was still tainted by the flood-dragon race. Because of this, its bloodline and power were no match for a True Dragon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This dragon’s bloodline wasn’t completely pure and it hasn’t fully matured just yet. This was the reason why its scales weren’t golden, only the shade. It was also why it only had four claws instead of five.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the situation was different, that this dragon had five claws and golden scales, then it would be beating Long Aotian to death right now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, it’s Fiercest!” The spectators watching the chase finally noticed Li Qiye in the distant sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is going on?

Two days ago, Aotian challenged Fiercest so given his unbridled personality, it would be strange if he wasn’t aiming for Aotian.” One person answered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aotian clearly knows that he’s being watched by Fiercest but he is still as unperturbed as ever while Fiercest is publicly following him. These two are really too aggressive and not afraid of anyone.” Even a big shot from the last generation had to comment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts were watching with bated breath.

Just surrender and submit and I shall benevolently spare you.” Aotian calmly spoke with complete confidence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Lin didn’t bother answer.

He had left his shadow on the tenth step of the twelve scales, on the same level as Ye Jiuzhou. &nbsp;Later on, he rarely showed his face or asked about worldly matters. Nevertheless, he was still the strongest demon monarch in the mind of his race. Meanwhile, Mount Qingcheng itself was mighty. Thus, no sects or experts dared to take them lightly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawr!” The dragon roared and jumped into the city.
