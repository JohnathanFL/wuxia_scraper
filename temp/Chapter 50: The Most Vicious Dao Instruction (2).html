<p>Having diligently read these merit laws, in this world, there was no one who understood and mastered these techniques and methods more than him!</p><p>Li Qiye struck Xu Pei around twenty times. Then, she couldn’t hold on any longer, fell to the ground, and she found it impossible to stand up. Li Qiye then let her off.</p><p>Li Qiye pointed at another disciple, and he cheerfully said: “Next.”</p><p>“Bang… Bang… Bang…” At this moment, all the other disciples also suffered the calamity; one after another, they were beaten by Li Qiye, and they laid motionlessly on the ground.</p><p>After Xu Pei’s words enlightened them, at the moment when Li Qiye was beating them, the other disciples were watching each strike from Li Qiye. Even though they were getting hit, each disciple still remembered Li Qiye’s every strike.</p><p>Now, everyone wanted to know the flaws in each of their moves and actions. Some wanted to cover their flaws, so that they wouldn’t be beaten so badly by Li Qiye; some wanted to use this opportunity to see their own weaknesses and to raise their own cultivation…</p><p>Although Xu Pei’s words had woken everyone up, not every disciple could see the flaws in their techniques and actions. Even if they could see the flaws within and know, personally, that their moves had flaws, they still wouldn’t be able to fix the underlying problems.</p><p>The other disciples weren’t as lucky as Xu Pei; Li Qiye was only beating them, he didn’t give them pointers.</p><p>In the end, the disciples who were beaten by Li Qiye lied on the ground, wailing moans filled the air. Li Qiye indifferently looked at them, and he then smiled, saying: “Today will end here. I’m giving you guys three days to rest. You should carefully think for a little bit, lest you make the same mistakes again.”</p><p>Finished speaking, he turned around and left.</p><p>Three days rest was as quick as a blink of the eye. Li Qiye, once again, appeared in the martial practice hall of the Cleansing Jade Peak. Li Qiye looked at the surrounding three hundred disciples, and he slowly said: “The contents of today’s lesson is still the same; it is still a beating.”</p><p>Li Qiye’s words made many students change their expressions; many students were afraid of Li Qiye and the taste of the Serpent Punishing stick, it was definitely not easy to endure – this type of pain, absolutely torturous.</p><p>Li Qiye stared at the three hundred disciples ahead, and he beamingly smiled: “Are you all coming out personally, or do I have to kill all the way to the door?”</p><p>“I will go first to fight against older brother.” Li Qiye had just finished his sentence, and the first to step up was Luo Fenghua. This was not Luo Fenghua’s first time to be the vanguard, but this Luo Fenghua coming out first was completely different from the past.</p><p>Luo Fenghua’s talents were not bad; within the three hundred disciples, his aptitude could be considered first or second. His cultivation was not shallow, and he could be said to be someone that was proud and arrogant.</p><p>When Li Qiye first arrived, he essentially didn’t obey. In reality, even after Li Qiye had beaten him with the Serpent Punishing stick, he was still not convinced in both his words and his mind all the way until he was blown away by Li Qiye’s one kick, breaking the bones of his body – this was when he suddenly woke up.</p><p>Even though Luo Fenghua was arrogant and proud, he wasn’t ignorant. Li Qiye’s one kick immediately trampled and shattered his bones; the power of this kick made Luo Fenghua realize the terribleness of Li Qiye!</p><p>At that moment, Luo Fenghua realized that Li Qiye was not a bag of straws like the rumors.</p><p>Especially after Xu Pei’s words that woke the disciples, afterward, each disciple was carefully studying each blow from Li Qiye. One sentence woke the people up from their dreams. Being beaten by Li Qiye, even though the majority of the disciples suffered from agonizing pain, these last three days, caused them all of them to open their eyes. Many meticulous disciples theorized Li Qiye’s strikes, and they had fruitful harvests regarding the flaws in their techniques.</p><p>Especially when these flaws were found out by pain; this made the disciples remember them very well.</p><p>Luo Fenghua’s talents weren’t bad, originally. On top of Xu Pei’s words, the last three days he had been contemplating, and it gave him not small benefits; he immediately understood Li Qiye’s good intentions, and inadvertently, his attitude towards Li Qiye had changed significantly.</p><p>Li Qiye beamingly smiled at Luo Fenghua, and he slowly said: “Even though you are one part arrogant and prideful, you are not ignorant to the point of stupidity.”</p><p>Arrogant Luo Fenghua; this time, on the other hand, his cheeks were red, he bowed his head, and he said: “Please guide me from my mistakes, older brother!”</p><p>This time, Luo Fenghua was sincere and serious.</p><p>Li Qiye also didn’t say many nonsensical words. He took out the Serpent Punishing stick, and he casually spoke: “Make your move.”</p><p>Luo Fenghua briefly said: “Excuse me…" After the words came out, going all out in effort, he let out a long roar; a brilliance – like a tsunami – rushed forward. Body like an eagle, stance like an aquatic dragon, commotions in the middle, and accompanied by a dragon tiger.</p><p>“Bang!” Luo Fenghua’s technique had only begun, but the Serpent Punishing stick had already directly struck. At the impact point, where his eyes were filled with yellow stars, tears were coming out.</p><p>Li Qiye, making a move, showed no mercy. One stick struck Luo Fenghua to the point where he couldn’t tell North, South, West, and East from each other. One stick came down, and Li Qiye indifferently said: “Combat on the battlefield is to avoid the lightning and fire; if you survive, this is akin to the enemy’s death. Between each technique, the best is the one that kills in one blow. Combat on the battlefield, it is truly not a viewing contest – beautiful techniques are nothing more than the silver decorations at the tip of a spear!”</p><p>“The move ‘Dragon Seizing the Hawk’ in the ‘Flying Dragon Fist’, is simply to kill, it does not have excessive and unnecessary variations; a form to murder and kill without needless additions.” Li Qiye, once again, struck the body of Luo Fenghua, and he said: “You considered yourself to be smart, and derived this move into a variation, and then another variation; seemingly profound; however, it is simply drawing legs on a snake, and impairs this killing move!”</p><p>Luo Fenghua’s perception was great; after Li Qiye finished speaking, he immediately changed his technique. The move was filled with a heroic aura and was direct, seemingly rough, like a hatchet chopping wood!</p><p>“This move’s variation isn’t bad; too hard an attack is easily broken. It has to be just right; between hard and soft.” Li Qiye was talking, but his hand never stopped moving. Showing no mercy, one stick repeatedly struck the face of Luo Fenghua until his face and nose were swollen.</p><p>“Bang… Bang… Bang…” Suddenly, Luo Fenghua had been struck a dozen times by Li Qiye. Without much effort, Luo Fenghua was knocked down to the ground, and the Serpent Punishing stick rendered him unable to stand up.</p><p>Being violently struck by the Serpent Punishing stick, Luo Fenghua was groaning from pain; however, his heart was ecstatic. This beating was not wasted as it gave him a fruitful harvest.</p><p>“Next.” Li Qiye mercilessly brought Luo Fenghua down to the ground, and he said this to the other disciples.</p><p>“Bang!” Finally, an older disciple next to Luo Fenghua went forward; however, after one move, he was struck by Li Qiye’s stick on his legs. He immediately fell to his knees.</p><p>“Your move is too slow!” Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye; another club flew out, and the frightened disciple rolled to this side, then the other side, and then he successfully escaped the stick.</p><p>“Bang… Bang… Bang…” After a while, the disciple was struck by Li Qiye, and he ended up with a swollen face. He, under the Serpent Punishing stick, had only lasted ten moves; however, these ten moves were not wasted since Li Qiye pointed out his incomplete moves one by one.</p><p>Half a day later, Li Qiye had finished beating all three hundred disciples. This time, it took longer compared to the past; each time a disciple was beaten, he was pointing out the incomplete variations in the disciple’s techniques.</p><p>Towards any disciple, Li Qiye did not show mercy. All three hundred disciples were beaten until they couldn’t stand up; at the moment, they kept on groaning with an unbearable pain. However, despite the tough pain, for many of the disciples, their harvests were great; their being beaten were not in vain!</p><p>In the next few days, each day Li Qiye was always beating the three hundred disciples one by one. However, all the disciples didn’t have any complaints; there were even some disciples that were happy to be beaten. Even though Li Qiye was not showing mercy with his Serpent Punishing stick, however, because of the big results, even worse pain would still have been worth it.</p><p>The Dao instruction of Li Qiye had left a deep impression on the three hundred disciples. Being beaten by Li Qiye so ruthlessly, even if they didn’t want to remember their flaws, it would be difficult. Using pain to trade for learning, it left a lasting impression.</p><p>Even though the method of Li Qiye’s Dao instruction was brutal, each disciple received great benefits. For the disciples, especially in the area of technique variations, these short few days were enough for them to learn truly profound technique variations. When their cultivations had flaws, previously, in the severe beatings, were re-molded.</p><p>Within the short few days, many disciples showed clear progress. Especially the disciples with good talents such as Luo Fenghua; his progress was even more obvious. Under the molding of Li Qiye, Luo Fenghua grasped the true meaning of his methods, so, within a few short days, each of his techniques and each of his variations were as meticulous as an antelope and as high as the peak.</p><p>Even though Li Qiye was brutal, his teachings were true knowledge; all of the disciples greatly benefited.</p><p>Seeing Li Qiye taking great responsibility with his Dao instruction, the disciples, towards Li Qiye, were without grievances.</p><p>Even though Sectional Leader Zhou rarely beat the disciples during his Dao instruction, Sectional Leader Zhou’s Dao instruction was with everyone gathered in one place. The sessions that he instructed on were very short, and they were akin to force-feeding. He presented the cultivation methods and their variations once; whether the disciples could understand, that was up to the individual disciples.</p><p>The three hundred disciples, each one had different talents and different perceptions. Even if they were to cultivate the same methods and the same techniques, their results would be different. This was why, during the moment of cultivation, there were natural biases. The strange thing was that some disciple’s cultivations were completely wrong.</p><p>Now, with Li Qiye’s one-on-one instruction and beating out the flaws of individual disciples, this gave each disciple a clear direction for cultivation. Regarding the profound variations of techniques, their understanding became deeper.</p><p>So, in just a few days, with regards to the variations of techniques, many disciples had seen the road; some had even taken steps on the road! This delighted many disciple’s hearts. A few short days of Li Qiye’s instruction were more fruitful than what they were studying for a year, even two or three years!</p>
