Moreover, the older soldiers from Azure Dragon dismembered Godkings as if they were mere cattle. That was the frightening part.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unfortunate that not too many people knew about this ancient legion.

In a sect with three emperors, an ancestor woke up while sitting on his throne inside a palace deep within. He focused his gaze at the Grand Sea and felt his hair standing on end after seeing the legion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ancient Ming Race turned to ashes after the Immortal Slaying War because the Azure Dragon Legion and the wise sages of the nine worlds surrounded and slaughtered the Dragon Ming Dynasty. During that period, the Ancient Ming had many supports so Azure Dragon took the vanguard to stop their waves of reinforcement with blood. This particular battle lasted for forty-nine days. The earth was covered by a bloody paste and in the end, Azure Dragon with sheer determination protected the last defensive line to stop any reinforcement. Finally, Immortal Emperor Long Ming was crucified on a peak. The screams of an emperor echoed across the nine worlds. That might be the most terrifying thing in all the ages. The emperor of that arrogant race was actually killed during their own era…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That battle astounded the inhabitants of the nine worlds. It was the fruit from the wise sages working together. However, without the Azure Dragon Legion, it wouldn’t have been as easy to massacre that dynasty, let alone killing their emperor!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This particular ancestor became emotional while thinking about the old war with heartfelt admiration for Azure Dragon and their tyrannical heroism.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many lineages dared to accept such a risky order during the Ancient Ming’s reign but Azure Dragon accepted this responsibility and completed it without letting anyone down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a different sacred ground, another eternal existence woke up and gazed at the legion: “The first, Azure Dragon Legion, the most amazing legion in the world, daring to fight against the Ancient Ming when no one else did. Alas, their casualty was too great. So many brave generals and soldiers fell in that battle so they could only retire afterward. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be Soaring Immortal’s turn to do whatever they want now. Just Azure Dragon alone would easily sweep through Soaring Immortal.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Barren Earth, a dying old man in an ancient clan sat up with tears in his eyes the moment he saw the legion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Azure Dragon protects the Son of Heaven.

Though no one had heard of the previously, the name, “Azure Dragon”, will be repeated everywhere henceforth. People were speechless even while others felt great admiration for the legion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the battle, the legion camped inside Pearl. The city was completely quiet and no one would dare to step inside. Many big shots were terrified to see the older soldiers in the legion. Their legs would uncontrollably tremble.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, inside the main hall of Pearl, Li Qiye and Wordkeeper sat together.

Our brothers paid a heavy price back then but unfortunately, I couldn’t keep everyone alive through the long years.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The true god couldn’t help but sigh after the past was brought up.

I heard Immortal Emperor Ren Xian’s sons have escaped from the Immortal Confinement so I want to see what kind of trouble they can bring.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Immortal Emperor Ren Xian was still in this world, then maybe they can do something. But just some imperial princes alone, there’s nothing they can do against you, Your Excellency.” The true god replied.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Princes or princesses, whatever.” Li Qiye was nonchalant: “I’m just curious about what they hid back then and the bloodline. I want to see who was the one who had their bloodline changed. I didn’t find it back then but I’m certain it is in Soaring Immortal.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes flashed with a terrible glint.

He had experienced the darkest years so he naturally wouldn’t allow it to happen a second time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Li Qiye was in no hurry: “It’s just that I couldn’t find the changed bloodline back then or Soaring Immortal wouldn’t exist right now.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, with Immortal Emperor Qian Li and the Black Dragon King, even Soaring Immortal had no other choice but to submit and let the Dark Crow search every inch of their land.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, the forceful search didn’t yield any result.

I hope that after I leave, the legion will still be famous across the nine worlds in order to deter a few people from having the same thoughts in the future.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, your burden is too heavy.” The true god cupped his fist and said: “If this was the past, I would want to follow and pave the way for you again with our brothers.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know of your devotion.” Li Qiye nodded and sighed: “However, there was too much casualty back then and I don’t want it to happen again to the legion. You all have paid enough. In the future, the war above the nine heavens will be even crueler.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You love us too much.” The true god said with sincerity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, it is because I owe everyone.” Li Qiye replied with a tinge of sadness: “I personally recruited each of you but how many brothers have been buried now? Their blood still stained the battlefields.”</span></p>
