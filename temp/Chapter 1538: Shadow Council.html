This made it impregnable like a fortress. Moreover, all of these spells came from sea gods and not just three or five of them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Few disciples knew about this place. For example, ordinary ancestors weren’t qualified to be aware of this place. Furthermore, because it was classified as a top secret location, only Hallowed was allowed to enter. Even the Seven Martial Goddess who knew the seven styles didn’t have this privilege.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only by becoming a sea god would she be granted entry and be privy to the true secrets in this place.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This practice wasn’t because Hallowed was selfish but it was due to the grave importance of this matter relating to the life-and-death of the pavilion or even all of the sea demons. Once someone else caught wind of it, the consequence would be unimaginable so Hallowed was very cautious about it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking Li Qiye here, he stood outside and told the guy: “Your Excellency, I can only bring you here and have no say in the actual negotiation itself.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was the only person who knew about this secret in the present era, he wasn’t qualified to interfere. Only sea gods and above could talk and discuss it!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know, I’ll be fine alone.” Li Qiye chuckled and leisurely strolled into the area.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the first step, a buzz came about with a flashing light. He disappeared in the next moment without a trace. This type of disappearance didn’t look like a teleportation at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next second, he appeared in an exceedingly mysterious area. No one could spy or enter without permission. Its coordinates were cryptic as well, unbeknownst to outsiders.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One would find a river of twinkling stars in the sky. It looked quite beautiful as if jewels were embedded up above. There were also strange gravels everywhere to make up the river on top of astral vortexes.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A platform floated in this space with a roundtable. There were shades sitting there with their aura converged. However, their style and posture alone showed that when these shades were still in the world, they were supreme existences capable of sweeping through the land!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled and said casually: “The shadow council, quite secretive indeed. Looks like many sea gods have joined now.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shades turned to look at him. Despite not being the true body of sea gods, their glare was still quite frightening. A Nine World’s Godking would find their legs becoming soft being the center of so many eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Li Qiye was still as nonchalant as ever. He dragged a chair over and sat down coolly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, I have been a fan of you long ago.” Eventually, one of the shades spoke. His voice was imposing despite the low volume. Nevertheless, it also soothed the soul and gave a safe feeling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it’s me.” Li Qiye looked at the shade and smiled: “It looks like there was a meeting here as well before wanting to meet me, Prime.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speaker was the Prime Sea God. Of course, his true body was no longer in this world. This was the case for all the sea gods.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, many sea gods still participated at this shadow council all along. It was considered the highest secret of the sea demon race. Because of its importance, its formation and goals were carefully guarded. Not all new sea gods were eligible to learn of this secret!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We had to be cautious before knowing that it was you, Your Excellency Dark Crow. After being reported by Hallowed, we had a deliberation and True Martial confirmed it. That’s how we figured out your identity.” Prime slowly explained.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Hallowed couldn’t decide a meeting with Prime and the council. However, he reported the stories to them so the council decided to meet with Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, long time no see. Our real bodies aren’t in the world anymore so we can’t greet you in full.” Another heavyweight at the table slightly bowed towards Li Qiye and spoke: “I didn’t think you would be interested in our council. In the past, you have never intervened.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this speaker was True Martial Sea God.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at him and smiled while shaking his head: “No, I’m not interested in your council at all. I’m simply here to make a deal.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“May I ask what kind of deal you want to make, Your Excellency?” Another shade asked. This shade resembled a bottomless ocean. He was the second sea god of the pavilion, Deep Blue!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Before talking about the deal, let us speak about the purpose of the council. If our goals don’t align, then we can’t come to an agreement.” Li Qiye smiled and said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere became serious. The sea gods present held their breath and didn’t say anything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to hide.” Li Qiye continued carefreely: “Then I’ll talk. The purpose of the shadow council is to deal with the Bonesea!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All eyes slightly moved after hearing this. Despite not being their real bodies, just a shift of their glare alone contained a mighty power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are seeking out all the possibilities so that the sea demon race can survive during the advent of the disaster.” Prime solemnly said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you can’t give me a clear answer, then we have nothing to talk about.” Li Qiye shook his head; “If you really wish for your race to survive, then you should be beseeching me, not the other way around.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sea gods around the table exchanged glances. They were very cautious.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can vouch for His Excellency.” In the end, True Martial broke the silence in a dignified manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Prime took a deep breath and began: “Your Excellency, you are the eternal overlord so I’m sure we can’t hide it from you either. Yes, I created the shadow council with such a thought in mind. However, the original intention was only to maintain some initiatives in the ordeal.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand, despite being sea gods and making a compromise once with the Bonesea, all of you don’t necessarily trust it. Because of this, you made some preparation before dying.” Li Qiye said with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, he peered around at each sea god and continued: “I’m not looking down on everyone here. If you were all alive and your real bodies were preserved until now, then yes, with everyone here, there is a chance that you might be able to oppose the Bonesea. But the current you won’t do. With your current state, how much strength can you actually exert when the time comes?”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sea gods here had no response. They naturally understood this full well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued on: “That’s why there are still some methods left. I can also guess what they are, so we’ll talk about that.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is your wish, Your Excellency?” True Martial spoke again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t want anything.” Li Qiye shook his head: “On the contrary, I came here bearing good news and hope, a light of dawn for everyone!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You mean?” The group was startled after hearing this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I came with good news. But first, I’ll reveal something. The disaster will come much earlier than your expectation, within one generation!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So early?!” Even True Martial was caught off guard.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sea gods looked around at each other. They have experienced countless storms and danger but they still shuddered after hearing this. Everyone had a serious expression now.</span></p>
