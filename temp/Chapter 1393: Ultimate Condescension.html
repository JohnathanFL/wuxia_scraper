In their eyes, an invincible existence was finally challenged by someone from the younger generation even when the older cultivators would refrain from doing so. They were breathless due to Puresun’s audacity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was completely different from Ruyan and Jianshi stepping up. The two women knew that they weren’t Zhentian’s match, but they had no choice but to fight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was different for Puresun. He challenged Zhentian in such a calm manner that it made people suddenly feel as if he was qualified to fight against him, an illusion of sorts.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Puresun was too reserved and his reputation was inferior to Profound’s, so his challenge to Zhentian took the crowd by surprise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Profound had the biggest reaction to this declaration. His eyes flashed as he was overwhelmed with excitement. He had always brooded about his brother not wanting to compete for the Heaven’s Will.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He understood just how strong his brother was despite his lackadaisical nature. This was how his brother should act all the time!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian laughed in response: “Gu Chun’s four branches are indeed wonderful. There is no denying that the two of you are incredible for being this strong at your age. I’m sure I was inferior to you when I was younger, but right now, you are not strong enough.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some felt great fear after hearing this. They didn’t expect the powerful Zhentian to admit that he was inferior to Puresun when he was at the same age!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being recognized as such was a great honor, a supreme glory of a lifetime. Others would be elated after hearing the praise, but Puresun simply chuckled: “There is always a higher step even at the highest level of enlightenment. In terms of cultivation and mastery, I am not your match as you have walked further than me, but there are things in this world that are too unpredictable. Only through fighting will the victor be known. But then again, even Immortal Emperors have lost. Both victory and defeat are merely methods of honing oneself, there’s no need to look at them as the deciding factor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puresun’s style looked exactly like someone who was undefeatable among the younger generation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Profound was applauding him in his mind. This was his brother’s graceful bearing — completely matchless in this world! His eyes lit up while waiting to see his brother’s true strength because he had never seen it before. Even as the junior brother, he didn’t know the extent of Puresun’s strength.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people found it hard to breathe after hearing this calm response to Zhentian. This type of demeanor proved just how mighty he was.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well said!” At this time, a loud laughter came as someone applauded: “It is a shame to have such a great mentality yet not compete for the Heaven’s Will.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People turned their heads and saw someone quickly approaching. He appeared before everyone in the blink of an eye. Ruyan, Jianshi, and Puresun also smiled after seeing this newcomer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fierce is back!” Someone shouted right away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I knew Fierce isn’t someone who’s afraid of trouble, he definitely wouldn’t flee.” An expert became very excited after seeing Li Qiye come back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some cultivators thought that Li Qiye wouldn’t dare to fight Zhentian so he ran. At this moment, this group didn’t dare to say anything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at Puresun and smiled: “The grand dao is endless and sometimes, finding a good opponent isn’t easy. I hope that I can find such an enemy when the battle for the Heaven’s Will comes along.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The daoist wryly smiled and shook his head: “I’m only a mortal… and… I don’t want to become dried bones beneath your feet either.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at Zhentian, he only talked to Puresun as if he didn’t care about Zhentian’s existence at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This attitude annoyed many of the charming spirits present. In their eyes, Zhentian was their pride, so this deliberate show of contempt was the same as slapping their faces! This made many of them scowl angrily.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Crimsonflame Ancestor was unhappy with this contemptuous act as well. He snorted and said: “Li Qiye, my master wants to see you!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being called out by name, Li Qiye finally looked over at Zhentian’s carriage and smiled: “What’s your business?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This indifferent attitude only made Crimsonflame even more annoyed. Li Qiye was acting as if his master was only a passerby. He couldn’t retort since Zhentian interjected: “Daoist Li, your means are incredible and have truly brightened my eyes, so I wish to spar with you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spar?” Li Qiye laughed in response: “Very well, whether it is a spar or revenge for your disciple, I’ll entertain you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His directness astounded the crowd. No one thought that Li Qiye would be so ready to accept. He looked like he was trying to get this over with or sending away a stray dog. There was no sign of caution at all. The charming spirits felt a little lost after witnessing this scene. Since Zhentian was quite powerful, Li Qiye should at least put up a more cautious front, but he simply didn’t care at all.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian replied: “No, I only wish to learn with you and have no intention of revenge. As for my disciple, his skill was inferior so there is nothing more I can say.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So be it.” Li Qiye smiled freely: “Do you want a fight to the death or stop appropriately? I am someone who prefers the former under normal circumstances.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators were enraged once more. Li Qiye spoke as if he was facing a nobody who was completely at his mercy, but this was Meng Zhentian! The greatest genius of the charming spirits! His nonchalant attitude was a blatant showing of disdain towards everyone here. The charming spirits glared at him since they felt slighted by his replies!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoist Lin and the Extreme Yang Monarch shared this sentiment and had to snort. Their feud with Li Qiye had gone past the point of reconciliation long ago! There was a promising future on the horizon, they thought, after joining Zhentian’s camp. Once Zhentian becomes emperor, their future would be boundless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, they shared honor and disgrace with Zhentian, so how could they not be angered by Li Qiye’s disrespectful attitude?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Either way is fine.” Zhentian smiled and said: “Why don’t we have a seat on your boat and slowly take our time to ponder the techniques and the wonderful grand dao…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not in a rush to fight Li Qiye. After all, the ultimate battle was inevitable once the Heaven’s Will comes out. He was more interested in what was inside the boneship since his intuition told him of its greatness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye immediately refused: “Sorry, not interested. We don’t share the same urine pot, so I don’t need to invite you onboard. If you want to fight, just come out and we’ll do fight, there’s no need for a tea party. If not, then you should go while I’m still in a good mood.”&nbsp;<a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye’s answer made many people glare at him. They knew a fight was inevitable, but Li Qiye maintained his disdainful tone, leaving zero consideration for Zhentian. This was the same as disrespecting all the charming spirits in Heaven Spirit!</span></p><p><span class="footnote" id="footnote_1">[1] A vulgar way of saying they’re not sharing the same path/being in the same camp.</span></p>
