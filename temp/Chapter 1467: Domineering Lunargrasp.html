He has revealed another old story to the astonishment of the crowd. The young ones had never heard about it. In their eyes, especially the younger sea demons, their divine prince was a supreme existence with a noble bloodline. Who would have thought that he was suppressed for a lifetime because of a single sentence from Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few ancient paragons from the previous generation had heard of it before. However, out of fear for the Conch Overlord’s power, no one was willing to talk about it. If the overlord were to know, it might bring about a fatal disaster.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being suppressed by the emperor was a great humiliation for the overlord. He didn’t know where to place his old face right now after Li Qiye told everyone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little animal, come out, I’m going to make mincemeat out of you!” A fiery rage spewed out from the overlord’s eyes. Li Qiye had uncovered his shame so he definitely wouldn’t forgive Li Qiye. Without killing the brat, this rage would never subside!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it that fun to tease them?” Lunargrasp coldly stared at Li Qiye and said: “Quickly deal with them already then go get the Heaven’s Will.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t put it like that.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand: “Since they want to team up to kill me, I should take my time destroying their morale first before killing them. No rush.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lunargrasp ignored him and walked forward while glaring at the overlord’s group: “Too much nonsense, we’re only wasting each other’s time. If the four of you are not convinced, come together. I’ll deal with you and dissolve this convention.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd became slack-jawed after hearing this. The word “domineering” wasn’t enough to describe her. One against four was unbelievable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These four were top experts; it could be said that few could match them in the contemporary. However, the fairy didn’t care for them and spoke as if she could make short work out of them. Just how confident and overbearing was this?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group had no response either. Her words pressed down on them like a mountain and made them feel breathless. It was because she wasn’t all talk, this was something within her abilities.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this brief moment, the cultivators here glanced at each other. This was the Lunargrasp Fairy, someone who had defeated Empress Hong Tian in the past, a genius who had swept through the nine worlds with marvelous achievements.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lunargrasp Fairy, there are still Emperor Assailant ancestors in this world.” The prince answered her challenge.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was to remind and warn her that she wasn’t the most powerful in Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed and freely asked: “Are you talking about the old man lying deep in the Spirit Abyss?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell him to come out.” The fairy emotionlessly spoke: “Only an Emperor Assailant, he’s not an Immortal Emperor!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only an Emperor Assailant! Such a powerful statement. Emperor Assailants were completely dreadful. In the eyes of many, these existences consisted of people like the Seven Hallowed Ancestor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the fairy made it sound as if they weren’t much at all, that they weren’t worth mentioning. Her confident and invincible style suffocated the atmosphere.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian’s group were quite uncomfortable, but they had to endure. Regardless of what happens against the fairy, the only person who would benefit from this was Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, if no one is going to fight, allow me to say a few words.” Li Qiye smiled and spoke after noticing that Zhentian’s group didn’t want to be the first to take the stage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sat on his imperial throne and casually swept through the crowd. At this moment, he turned into a supreme ruler of the nine heavens and ten earths.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is good that you all have started this meeting. Very well, if this is to decide who will become the next emperor and sea god, I’ll make the decision for everyone.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a bit before smiling: “Naturally, no one else will become emperor but me in this generation! As for the sea god position, I’ll also pick someone. It shall be the Seven Martial Goddess.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd didn’t know how to react to this. It was understandable that he would claim to be emperor considering his arrogant attitude. However, his appointment of the goddess took everyone by surprise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many thought that his candidate would be the True Martial Goddess. After all, she had advantages far beyond her competitors, not to mention that she was on his side at the moment. Thus, this strange decision made everyone think that the Seven Martial Pavilion was also on his side.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian coldly said: “Li Qiye, you can’t become emperor just because you want to.” He no longer referred to Li Qiye as “Daoist Li” as he was unable to restrain his anger.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye flatly denied: “If I say I’ll become emperor, then I’ll become emperor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” The Seashield Prince snorted at this time. He was quite unhappy as well since he was one of the candidates to become the sea god this generation. Several behemoths in Heaven Spirit had made a deal. In particular, the sea demons had reached a consensus that if the True Martial Goddess had no objections, the Seashield Prince would have priority over the Seven Martial Goddess.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, Li Qiye has chosen his rival before everyone could say anything, how could the prince not become angry?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince didn’t dare to yell at Li Qiye, but the overlord couldn’t let this develop any further. If the convention actually decided for the Seven Martial Goddess to be the next sea god, it would be very unfavorable for the prince.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The overlord coldly exclaimed: “Junior, a human like you is an outsider. Since when do outsiders get to dictate our sea demons’ business? The position of the sea god has to be decided by us!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I agree for the Seven Martial Goddess to become the next sea god!” The True Martial Goddess added with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many were shaken after hearing this. This came from a very influential person, and she didn’t seem to be kidding.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With her support, it meant that the Seven Martial Goddess would have an advantage over the Seashield Prince.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Roaring Conch was quite inferior to the Seven Martial Pavilion in terms of strength and influence; its status was not as prestigious among the sea demons. Even though the Seashield Prince had the overlord as his backing, the pavilion also had people on the same level as the overlord.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reason why the conch decided to work together with the other great powers in Heaven Spirit to shake the pavilion’s influence. But now, the True Martial Goddess’ open support immediately weakened the prince’s position. The Seven Martial Goddess’ status had been elevated. The island and the pavilion working together with a sea god’s daughter could definitely change the overall situation of the sea demon race.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, as long as the pavilion said the word, many sea demon lineages would stand with them and this new alliance would completely suppress the conch’s prestige! The overlord was alarmed to hear this open support from the True Martial Goddess.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your descendant, Seashield, has no chance of becoming a sea god.” Li Qiye flatly said before the overlord could retort: “Tell him to come out since he has attacked one of my people. The wisest thing for him to do now is to take the initiative and accept his responsibilities.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, what do you want!” The overlord glared at Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing.” He smiled in response: “Don’t worry, I won’t do anything or people will call me a bully. The person he attacked will be the one to kill him! Of course, I will give him a fair chance since that’s just who I am!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, Su Yonghuang slowly came out. People held their breaths since everyone here knew about the feud between her and Seashield.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The overlord coldly uttered: “The convention of myriad races isn’t suitable for a duel!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t want Seashield to fight under these circumstances. Winning was one thing, but if he were to lose, it would be a great blow to his status.</span></p>
