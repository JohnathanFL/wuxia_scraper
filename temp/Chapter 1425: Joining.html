<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She stood there coldly after getting dressed in silence. She wanted to say thanks, but the words wouldn’t come out. This was her nature, and the path of an assassin had only amplified it. The words “thank you” were too difficult to say since self-reliance was her way of life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gestured for her: “Come.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She hesitated for a moment but still walked in front of him. He placed his right hand on her breast, causing her feminine mind to tremble.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sudden move from Li Qiye made her take a step back. After all, an innocent girl like her had never experienced something like this before.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve seen everything already.” Li Qiye looked at her and flatly said: “If I wanted to take advantage of you, would I need to wait until now?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Recently, she had been heartless as if she was transforming into an ice sculpture. Her emotions rarely swayed due to being an assassin. However, after hearing this, she felt an urge to beat Li Qiye up. It could be said that this man was really asking for it by saying such words.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, she took a deep breath and took one step forward to stand in front of him again. His right hand met her chest again and the same shudder ran through her mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could feel his strong palm full of calluses through the thin clothing. It was rough yet powerful, giving her a sense of security. A feeling of pins and needles spread from her chest to the rest of her body. This was a strange feeling she never had before.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” His hand lit up like a lamp and her body followed suit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” A metallic noise came about as laws intertwined around his palm. Space seemed to have been dislocated since it lit up around Sima Yujian. She saw these chain-like laws locking her space and suppressing her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, the laws entered her body and lit up the space within. With this, everything became sealed both inside and out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The sound of a lock unlocking came about. The laws that entered this space seemed to be unlocking one shackle after another.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After these mysterious shackles were unlocked, the mysterious laws in this space retreated like spirit snakes and vanished without a trace.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, her entire body trembled. She felt the lock press down on her body disappearing. A loud blast ensued as her vitality majestically erupted and returned like a soaring dragon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was quite startled and finally understood that he had removed the suppression from Godhalt from her body. Her regular cultivation was back at last.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing this, Xiaoxiao asked him: “You can actually undo the oppression of Godhalt?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye looked at her and flatly said: “Nothing’s strange about it. At Godhalt, there are secrets and rules to follow. Why is it that so many people come to the abyss for help after arriving here? It is because they can undo this suppression. However, unlike me, they rely on treasures to do so.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the aloof Yujian had to ask: “And what about you?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled in response: “As long as I follow the rules, everything can be undone. Godhalt has obscured some mysteries, so as long as you understand them, you can undo the suppression.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it wasn’t easy to ponder these mysteries. Just this alone required Li Qiye, as the Dark Crow, to spend a long time and many trips to this place before achieving success.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yujian reverted to her frosty and silent demeanor. It gave a piercing feeling and made others not want to go near her. Li Qiye looked at her and said: “Even though I won’t accept a disciple, from today on, you will follow me so that I can teach you the Godslaying Dao!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This prompted her to stare at him intensely. As a woman of few words, she actually wanted to question him to dispel her skepticism.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t believe that he could guide her on this path. After all, an outsider couldn’t possibly teach her the Godslaying Dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can cultivate it myself.” She coldly refused him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gave her the side-eye in response: “By yourself? Too slow! You think I want to bring an unwanted stepchild everywhere? Your dao is only at this level, yet you dare to come to the abyss for a mission? Don’t smear the reputation of the Godslaying Night Corps! To let someone as weak as you inherit the corps’ ultimate techniques is an affront to its prestige!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” She was livid after hearing this despite being an emotionless assassin and glared at him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t need to angrily stare at me in disagreement.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “If you have truly grasped the essences of the Godslaying Dao, you wouldn’t have failed today. Moreover, the Coiling Dragon Sword would be in your possession. Even though you were selected as the successor, you are not at the level to wield the sword, the weapon that represents the supreme prestige of the Godslaying Dao!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had no response to his claim. Despite feeling some anger, he indeed pointed out her insufficiencies correctly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He commanded again: “Come, let me have a look at your sea of memories.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She immediately retreated after hearing this. For any cultivator, this wasn’t something they could show to anyone, not even the closest confidants.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He noticed her guard and lightly said: “You think there’s a point to being cautious of me? If I wanted to see your memories, there is no escaping since you can’t resist me. Besides, if I want the merit laws and secrets of the night corps, I wouldn’t need to use you either since your knowledge is too limited! As long as I give the command, your masters would tell me everything!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yujian didn’t lower her vigilance and stood there motionlessly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come here!” Li Qiye glared at her and spread out his mighty aura. When he turned serious, others would be nervous and fearful. He had become a supreme existence that hands out orders!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yujian was shaken and felt a primal fear. This wasn’t because she wasn’t strong enough. For some unknown reasons, she couldn’t refuse him and walked forward as if possessed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His dignified demeanor left no room for resistance. She felt as if he was the king of the night, the ruler of darkness. He possessed a charisma that she had no answer for. In fact, she was strong enough to resist even a Godking. Unfortunately for her, she had met Li Qiye. He could be considered the creator of the Godslaying Dao, the unquestionable lord of the Godslaying Night Corps, its real master.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he left an unerasable mark on this dao. In the past, he had ruled over the entire corps, so how could she resist him, the king of the night?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Xiaoxiao was greatly affected by Li Qiye’s temperament. When he became dignified, she was startled and found it difficult to refuse him. Anyone would feel the urge to obey.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of how strong one might be, the moment this supreme tyrant becomes angry, they would quickly prostrate before him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yujian was now standing inches from Li Qiye. He raised her icy face and profoundly stared into her. She felt no choice but to obediently raise her head to meet his gaze.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” His eyes illuminated her sea of memories as well as the deepest depths of her soul!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, an even more incredible thing happened. The sealed location in her mind suddenly unlocked completely with a click.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Keep in mind that every lineage had their own methods. After each disciple learns a particular merit law, certain parts of their memories would be sealed so that outsiders couldn’t forcefully open it lest they risk their minds blowing up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of sealing domain was mainly used to prevent their disciples’ memories from being forcefully read by the hands of masters. It rendered stealing entirely impossible.</span></p>
