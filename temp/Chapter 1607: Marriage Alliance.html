Zi Cuining will marry Long Aotian! They will meet to talk about the marriage at Soaring Immortal’s territory.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an uproar after this news since there had been rumors previously. However, they came from different channels, not the official ones like right now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, though many believed it, some remained skeptical until this official announcement. The alliance was no longer limited to speculation but more of a sure thing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two behemoths in our generation are still deciding to join forces.” One ancestor from a great power murmured in a daze.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any insightful person would know the result of this alliance. It meant that nothing would be able to stop them since one had five emperors and the other reigned for the most recent three generations. Perhaps an Immortal Emperor would be able to stop them but nothing else in the nine worlds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Soaring Immortal had been separated from the nine worlds for a long time, they indeed need the support from Heaven Suppression. Nothing could be more perfect and powerful than this alliance.” Even Godkings from the last generation were aghast after hearing this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great powers in the Grand Sea had the biggest reaction since they didn’t want to see this the most. This alliance would infringe on all of their territories. It meant that all decisions on the region could be arbitrarily made by just two sects. Everyone else must listen because these two could turn a great power to ashes overnight. Alas, no one could change the situation.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, many enjoyed talking about it as well, especially the younger crowd. They didn’t care for the politics and balance of power, only the angle of romance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard Heaven Suppression Goddess was very close to Fiercest back in Eastern Hundred Cities. There were some rumors about them being lovers in the Heavenly Dao Academy too.” A gossiper revealed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, Fiercest is indeed strong enough to be arrogant but nowadays, the only thing that matters is one’s origin. He came from Cleansing Incense, that’s nothing. It’s a different story for Aotian with Soaring Immortal. He has the lineage of an emperor and the arts of five, such a noble upbringing. How can a nobody like Li Qiye match him? With the goddess’ proud background, she naturally should be together with a heavenly prince like Aotian.” An old-fashioned cultivator said with disdain.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some immediately became unhappy with this guy who thought he was better than everyone else just because of his background. One young cultivator, who was a big fan of Li Qiye, retorted: “So what if they have noble upbringing? Hmph, Fiercest doesn’t give a damn. Oppose him and even imperial children will be slaughtered like dogs, not worth mentioning.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right.” Many vagabonds agreed with the sentiment: “You think having a noble upbringing is that great? Fiercest never lacked women before. So many prestigious princesses and saintesses are willing to marry him. Fairy Mei, Sword Goddess Bai, all of them are from imperial lineages and they want to follow him anyway…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most cultivators from smaller sects and especially the vagabonds disliked hearing contemptuous remarks the most from the nobles. They found such rhetoric to be contemptuous.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Cleansing Incense was a downtrodden sect. Thus, in their eyes, Li Qiye’s achievement was a breakthrough for them so they viewed him as their pride!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I agree. Fiercest won’t have a lack of women just because of his accomplishments. He can get as many as he wants.” Another person added: “Heaven Suppression Goddess only agreed to marry Aotian because of the marriage alliance, it doesn’t mean that she likes him. She probably loves Fiercest even more. After all, he was her first love back at the academy…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The debates became fiercer and eventually turned into scandals. Many began to spout that Li Qiye and the goddess promised to marry each other back at the academy. Thus, the current marriage proposal was purely political in nature.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, I heard that Fiercest will steal the bride for sure.” Some unknown cultivators spread this message. Who knows their real intent behind this?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Steal the bride, really now?” Many were stunned after hearing this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One hundred percent. Just think about it, who is Fiercest? Has he been afraid of anyone? Soaring Immortal and Aotian are nothing to him, same with Heaven Suppression City! If Aotian dares to steal his woman, he might try to trample both the city and Soaring Immortal!” A speaker swore to his friend about the validity of this rumor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of the ulterior motives of the message, many people found it reasonable. They all knew about Fiercest’s temper and merciless nature. There was nothing he didn’t dare to do in this world. It would be strange if he didn’t try to flip Soaring Immortal over since Aotian was trying to steal his woman.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiercest will definitely teach Soaring Immortal a lesson!” The helpless great powers wanted this particular development.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the Peacock Bright Monarch immediately reported to Li Qiye about the commotion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye simply smiled after hearing about the marriage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid Ancestor Ye’s group is forcing the City Lord. Maybe she lost her authority now.” The monarch worriedly said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With me here, Gu Zun’s tricks won’t amount to anything.” He chuckled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monarch quietly nodded since she couldn’t do anything with her own power so she placed her hope on him. She stared at him for a bit but refrained from speaking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go ahead.” Li Qiye took note and said with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She smiled wryly with a strange expression before speaking: “Rumor has it that you and the city lord had a marriage pact back at the academy so a lot of people think you will go steal the bride.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s just a message sent by the local great powers.” Li Qiye laughed: “Very well, if people want to have a show, then why not? It’ll be lively when I go do it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He certainly understood that people wanted to egg him on. However, he didn’t really mind. Since Gu Zun was aiming for him, he wanted to return the favor by destroying the alliance. He went to see the matriarch afterward.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She also heard the news and said instantly: “This is Gu Zun’s plan. He wants to drag Soaring Immortal down and use its power to oppose you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know.” Li Qiye replied: “Gu Zun knows himself that he alone can’t take me on at all so he requires an ally, and who is better than Soaring Immortal? Is there a more powerful lineage compared to Soaring Immortal in the nine worlds?”</span></p>
