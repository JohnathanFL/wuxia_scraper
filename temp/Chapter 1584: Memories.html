This can all happen with a single thought. It certainly did for the three of you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sentimentally continued: “Qian Li’s background was a bit worse, same with her conditions, but her confidence never wavered. She knew she would become a dragon one day to obtain the Heaven’s Will. That’s why she became an emperor. As for Lil Blackie, he loved challenges. Such a madman who only wanted to fight. That’s why he ruled for three generations. He broke through his own limit in each of them while taking a different path each time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stared at the old man and said: “As for you, Zhengfeng, you are either hiding or just plain weary of it all. That’s why you don’t want to leave your nest and ultimately became a shopkeeper with only this lamp as your friend.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I agree. Qian Li had her imperial path while the Black Dragon King had his tyrannical dao. As for me, I probably can’t defeat my inner demon.” The old man said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Inner demon? Others might have this but not you. This path leads to being loathed by the heavens. What inner demon can you have? What is scarier than being unwanted by the heavens?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That makes sense too.” Zhengfeng smiled leisurely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye only shook his head and drank the fine wine. In his eyes, Zhengfeng didn’t have that many flaws. It was just that his chosen path leads to darkness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Zhengfeng was <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Matriarch Yu</span>’s older brother and was from the same era as the Black Dragon King and Immortal Emperor Qian Li.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was younger, the Yu was only a minor clan. His sister back then suffered a terminal illness. All the famous doctors gave up on her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to save his sister, he tried his best at cultivation to become an invincible being. The karmic nature of life willed it so. During an adventure, he found Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo’s supreme grand dao. Henceforth, he embarked on a peerless path.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were geniuses everywhere in that era. He, the Black Dragon King, and Immortal Emperor Qian Li were always together because of Li Qiye. Others praised them as the three heroes back then.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, Zhengfeng fell in love with the emperor. However, she was hellbent on her imperial path without looking back while not having any feelings for him. Zhengfeng eventually lost to her in the competition as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made him dejected. Despite having the power to challenge an emperor, he grew bored of the mundane world so he returned to Discover to open a pub and spend his day doing nothing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for his sister, the Dark Crow back then gave him the right treatment. However, the materials required were too difficult to find since they were immortal medicines.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus he had no choice but to seal his sister until Immortal Emperor Qian Li found the mythical immortal medicines. Zhengfeng then asked Li Qiye for help and they finally cured <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Matriarch Yu</span>.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bit later, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Matriarch Yu</span> joined the Black Dragon Legion. This was when Zhengfeng completely shut himself from everything and the world forgot about him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew that there was an incredible master hiding in this tiny pub.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, I admire you the most out of everyone. I don’t know how you keep on going, I certainly can’t do it.” He took a sip after pouring another cup for Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just have to keep walking.” Li Qiye drank and said with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled wryly: “Easier said than done. You have been walking for millions of years now. That’s a very long period. You must have suffered endlessly, bidded farewell to many love ones and even buried them yet you didn’t go crazy or became a devil. You were certainly not a saint either nor choose to hide from the world. You are yourself after the arduous time, never changing your determination regardless of the perilous challenges. The winds and rains accompanied your journey with the stench of blood. Black Dragon King once said that if he had experienced so much pain like you, he would have started to hate the world and become a monster! Your dao heart isn’t something we juniors can compare to.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He finished his cup in one gulp before letting out a long sigh.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye actually didn’t know what to say and continue drinking quietly. The guy was right. He has sent away and even buried many loved ones. He had many friends and loyal confidants once but ultimately, he was the only one left. Numerous had died from old age while he continued to live on!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most painful thing in life was not death. It was watching those close to you die one by one. At this point, death became sweet relief.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s a fair amount of people who have lived just as long in this world.” Li Qiye said flatly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhengfeng disagreed: “I know, you have told me about them but they’re not actually living, only sealing themselves by sleeping. It’s not the same as you who tread on the mortal plane for generations. Time and mundanity washed your body but they can’t break your will and heart!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s good to be alive.” Li Qiye answered. It wasn’t the perfect response since he didn’t know how to help the guy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhengfeng understood all the logic and rationalities right now. If he wanted to jump out of his dao, he must rely on himself. The problem was that he didn’t care for it so Li Qiye couldn’t help him at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhengfeng nodded and drank silently.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two continued drinking. After a while, Zhengfeng slowly said: “I saw Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo on the grand dao!”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye pondered for a bit before smiling wryly: “Sigh, the emperor has too much of an influence on this dao. At this moment, he might be better and had walked further than you so that’s why you can see him.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He can’t leave it and is just walking around in a circle. If you go on, you’ll be just like that stubborn guy.” Li Qiye shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s already an emperor, why is he going back on this path?” Zhengfeng found this puzzling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye elaborated: “Who knows? Just him, probably. The guy has always been a controversial emperor, different from the others. Even after ascending, he kept to himself. Maybe in his mind, he’s too far removed from the world.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It could be fate then. The emperor and I are somewhat similar.” Zhengfeng answered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye said earnestly: “Perhaps. The two of you have failed in love before but this isn’t the reason or the end. The path is still beneath your feet. It was created after he became emperor. He didn’t embark on it during his youth. Moreover, his heart remained unchanging despite romantic frustration and pain, that’s why he could still become emperor. But as for why he returned in the future, it might not be related to worldly matters. You and Mu Zhuo are not the same.” Li Qiye stared at Zhengfeng and finished.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo was a very reclusive and mysterious emperor. For many emperors, they would shine after ascension. Moreover, there would be many friends and followers both before and after. Many were willing to fight for them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo was an exception.

That’s why he returned to this path.” Zhengfeng speculated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not necessarily.” Li Qiye denied: “He had two marriages on top of many lovers. His heart shouldn’t have been too lonely.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was born in a declining family. Because of this, his fiancee betrothed to him at a young age married a richer husband later on.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This inspired the emperor and he started to rise and become a famous hero with sufficient power. This allowed him to marry the prettiest girl in the region.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, tragedy struck again. His wife had an affair with a peerless genius in the nine worlds. It was quite a blow to the emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gave up all of his wealth and dissolved his sect before slumbering in a forest away from the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After skipping a generation, he came out and shocked the world once more to eventually become emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, he found many lovers and eventually married one world’s most beautiful woman.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such achievements were the lifelong pursuit of many people. However, the emperor felt life was dull and left quietly.
