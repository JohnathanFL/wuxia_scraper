They did try to resist but it was futile. In the end, these demons were forced to retreat while Soaring Immortal gained complete control.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a move attracted plenty of criticisms but nothing came of it due to the sheer power of the sect. In fact, before the reign of the Black Dragon King, Soaring Immortal’s influence spanned across the nine worlds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, they had five emperors so they had extraterritorial headquarters all around.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strangely enough, during Immortal Emperor Qian Li’s generation, the sect suddenly left all of these headquarters; not a single disciple was left behind. From then on, they rarely showed up in the nine worlds again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People didn’t know what the heck was going on but the disappearance of this behemoth was a good thing for many great powers. Nobody actually wanted to have such a threat looming around them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, the sect was back and used an unstoppable momentum to take over this region. This worried the cultivators in Mortal Emperor. The announcement of the alliance with Heaven Suppression shook the mind even more.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Henceforth, many eyes were fixated on their every move. Of course, others paid attention to Fiercest as well. The majority of people, especially the ones in this area, wanted to use Fiercest to retaliate against Soaring Immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The romance rumors between Fiercest and the goddess became even more intense as if it was the truth. Whether it be deliberate or not, in short, everyone knew that these two had a marriage pact back at the Heavenly Dao Academy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young generation had a wonderful time talking about how Aotian dared to compete against Fiercest. They wanted nothing more than to come and watch the bride-stealing show in person.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiercest is here.” People immediately discovered the moment Li Qiye and the Peacock Bright Monarch made it to the Soaring Immortal Sect’s territory. This news immediately spread with an unbelievable speed across the region.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is he really taking the bride away?” All eyes were on Li Qiye. The great powers became excited since this was what they have been waiting for. Fiercest was actually here.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did I tell you? Fiercest is invincible and prideful. He isn’t afraid of anyone. Someone like Aotian is nothing, this guy thinks he can steal Fiercest’s woman? He’s about to be annihilated!” Some young fans felt their blood boiling after seeing Li Qiye.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a few noble youths disagreed. One snorted in response: “Fiercest might be strong but all of you are blind, can’t even see who Young Emperor Long is. His backing is the Soaring Immortal Sect with countless Godkings and even Emperor Assailants. Hmph, no one has dared to oppose Soaring Immortal all this time. Nothing good will come of it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what? Aotian is just a dog relying on his sect then. Fiercest will kill the weakling so fast.” Li Qiye’s supporter retorted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be so sure. Young Emperor Long has a grand completion physique. He’s unstoppable among the young generation. Even the older generation can’t take him on.” Long Aotian’s fans instantly shouted back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiercest has thirteen palaces, one and only in the ages. A grand completion Immortal Physique is shit, there have been too many of them already!” Li Qiye’s support bit back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Emperor Long has triple saint talents and the arts of five emperors.” The other side contested.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiercest has thirteen palaces!” This sentence was repeated to show Li Qiye’s unique achievement and invincibility.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Emperor Long is the Denary King; he fought against the world for ten days and ten nights without faltering, going against millions and even killing Godkings…” Aotian’s supporters were still unconvinced.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiercest has thirteen palaces!” Li Qiye’s supporters chanted this sentence even louder.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Aotian’s side trembled with anger without a response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fiercest’s amount of palaces had rendered all geniuses in this world breathless. Neither their achievements and brilliance mattered; all paled before the thirteen palaces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the ages, there have been many Immortal Emperors and grand completion users. However, Li Qiye was one-and-only.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, the duo entered Soaring Immortal’s area. They saw immortal energy and mist everywhere. Pavilions could be faintly seen in the distance along with big ships. Trees were connecting together to form large landmasses.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People had to admit that the sect was able to turn this area into a land of immortals in such a short time. It showed just how terrifying the number of resources they had at their disposal was.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that their trash could please a great power. This was the style of a sect with five emperors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clang! Clang! Clang!” The gong of war resounded. The disciples from Soaring Immortal became vigilant. Both ordinary members and even elders were getting ready for battle.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soaring Immortal might claim its supremacy but it didn’t underestimate Fiercest at all. They knew of his battle records all too well. Most recently, he destroyed their Skyfire Warships. In the past, he killed their Godkings and banished their spatial channel. This was a worthy foe!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eruptive atmosphere between the two sides robbed the breath of spectators. Some were eager for a fight already.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? This is how your sect treat a guest?” Li Qiye leisurely smiled and said as if strolling through a garden.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even his enemies or those who hated him admired his boldness. Being able to smile before Soaring Immortal was very impressive. Their legs would be trembling if put under the same situation!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This leisure attitude made the experts from Soaring Immortal glance at each other. They didn’t know whether they should start fighting or not.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is Long Aotian going to fight?” One cultivator murmured.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Aotian isn’t here. He led some experts and ancestors to hunt the sea monsters right now at the depths.” A well-informed spectator shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, what do you want?” An instructor from Soaring Immortal took a deep breath and asked with a serious tone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soaring Immortal found this situation difficult to accept. All of this time, their sect has been sweeping through everything without resistance. They have never met such a strong enemy before.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t show the slightest carelessness and understood that elder-level characters weren’t enough to stop Fiercest. The lowest requirement to confront Fiercest was Godking!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing. I heard that my old friend, the Heaven Suppression City Lord is a guest at your sect, so I’m here to see her.” He said slowly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So domineering, he got straight to the point.” The experts nearby secretly praised. Only Fiercest would be so unrestrained against Soaring Immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elders here were silent in contemplation. If it was someone else demanding this, they might have even killed the guy under their fury. However, they needed to be careful when it came from Fiercest.</span></p>
