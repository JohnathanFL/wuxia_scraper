In the beginning, they lacked intelligence but with the passage&nbsp;of time, they began to evolve.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, some demons and sea monsters mated and this expedited the process. They became smarter and built their own home.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, the sea monsters commonly known in the Grand Sea were the offsprings of demons and the old sea monsters.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these offsprings still maintained their unique characteristics even through the long years.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to this relationship, many in this region listed sea monsters together with the demon race. However, some sea demons rejected this notion. Thus, sea monsters became its own classification instead of a particular race.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, these two different camps were still very close, sharing both glory and humiliation. Because of this, they gathered forces to fight against the invader, Soaring Immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Lin’s ancestor was rumored to be a gigantic dragon sleeping under the sea. Who knows if this was true or not, but he had golden draconic scales since birth along with a pair of green horns.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it was due to his noble origin and great bloodline that he was very powerful since youth, capable of tearing apart his enemies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he grew older, his cultivation increased by leaps and bounds. As a teenager, he became the undisputed leader of the sea monsters’ young generation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the invasion, he became a great role model for the soldiers and used his trident to fight against Soaring Immortal. He also challenged Long Aotian but alas, he lost the fight and nearly died. His seniors had to save him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, no one could stop Soaring Immortal’s momentum so Hai Lin and his allies had to fight and retreat back to the sea. Long Aotian didn’t let up and gave chase so it was strange that Hai Lin was here now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back to the present, the elder loudly declared: “You are only a loser to my young lord, no need for him to become Immortal Emperor before killing you!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so?” Hai Lin laughed: “I don’t know whether Aotian can kill me or not but I’m certain of one thing. I’m killing one of his hounds today!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was amazed by his boldness. This was an elder from Soaring Immortal. How many people nowadays would dare to call one of them a hound?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder became livid and exclaimed: “Hai Lin, cease your presumptuousness! One of us will die today!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could the elder endure this humiliation as a revered elder from the great Soaring Immortal Sect? Despite knowing that he was not Hai Lin’s match, he still had to fight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perfect, taste my trident!” Hai Lin didn’t waste words and pierced straight at the elder.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Activate!” The elder crazily roared and used his imperial laws. The figure of an Immortal Emperor emerged in the sky like a mountainous shield. There were numerous imperial runes carved on this shield with sonorous hymns.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It can be said that this elder was also a top expert in the contemporary. Many youths felt their knees shaking under the aura of an emperor and were instantly suppressed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, he was encountering the ferocious Hai Lin today. Hai Lin soared like a dragon in the sky. His trident seemingly turned into a dragon claw and mercilessly scratched the shield.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The shield shattered under this attack and the elder went flying from the impact. Lin Hao was shocked and quickly flew forward to catch his master.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Lin’s power stunned the crowd. They didn’t think he would be so powerful; no wonder why he could survive after fighting against Long Aotian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Too bad for you. If you had an imperial weapon, you could struggle for a bit longer.” Hai Lin pointed his trident at the elder and uttered coldly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Lin might not be as powerful as Long Aotian but few could be his rivals among the young generation. Moreover, his pure and prestigious bloodline gave him a battle advantage over people at the same cultivation level. Lastly, the trident in his hand was a mighty ancient artifact.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite being from the depth of the sea as well, he didn’t come from the ancient heritage like Wolong Xuan. Nevertheless, his bloodline was still very exceptional.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do as you please.” The elder had a strong backbone and didn’t bother trying to escape.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very well, I’ll take your dog head today as revenge for my people.” Hai Lin aimed his trident at the elder with a cold glint in his eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Noble Hai, please show mercy.” A group dashed over with an old man leading the charge and shouting from the distance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clan Master Yu is here.” A spectator recognized the old man.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After arriving, the old man hurriedly spoke: “Young Noble Hai, Discover is a city of peace, don’t bring the conflict here.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the current clan master of the Yu. In a short time, all eyes were on Hai Lin. Though the Clan Master wasn’t a top expert, he had a wide network of connections in the Grand Sea. Because of his clan’s position, he enjoyed a high status in this region.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bringing conflict here?” Hai Lin sneered: “Clan master, this is not me ignoring you and your clan but it is my feud with Soaring Immortal. They killed my brothers so I shall kill their disciples. Blood for blood.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young noble, it is better to make peace. How about my clan acting as a mediator today? If you let go of the elder, you can name the condition.” The clan master slowly said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t wish to see this elder die at Discover. After all, the elder came to congratulate his clan so face would be lost if the elder were to die here.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clan master, I didn’t see your clan at the battlefield maintaining justice and speaking up for us when Soaring Immortal took over our territory.” Hai Lin spoke coldly: “But now, you’re speaking up for Soaring Immortal?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clan master’s expression became awkward. All he could say was: “The battlefield is one thing, but this is Discover, you can’t conflate the two.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid I can’t obey. His head is mine today.” Hai Lin chose against showing the clan master some sensibilities and said coldly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clan master was put in a difficult dilemma. It was either to fight Hai Lin to save the elder or just to watch the guy die.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spare this elder and your race shall have the same treatment at Discover.” A stern and mighty voice came about as a newcomer appeared before the clan master.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued on: “No one shall touch your tribe members as long as they’re in Discover, not even the Soaring Immortal Sect!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father.” The clan master quickly bowed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a middle-aged man who looked much younger than the clan master so the clan master’s address came as a surprise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ancestor Yu.

The Yu Clan wasn’t big but it had three Godkings, a force enough to overshadow many imperial lineages.

Unfortunately, two of them have died or the clan would be even more illustrious in the present.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ancestor Yu, are you sure?” Hai Lin’s eyes became serious.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I stay true to my words.” The ancestor spoke: “As long as my clan is here, your members can rest easy at Discover.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So be it, I can also keep my words.” Hai Lin took a deep breath and put away his trident.
