<p><b>Emperor’s Domination – Chapter 199: Bloody Battle (1)</b></p><p>“There’s nothing difficult about destroying the Nine Saint Demon Gate’s Heavenly Grotto!” On the battlefield, another young prodigy laughed ruthlessly and unleashed all of his unstoppable emperor techniques! This young man was Jikong Jian, a disciple of the Space Trample Mountain!</p><p>After the feud with Li Qiye on the Ancient Street that day, Jikong Jian began to support Dao Child Sheng Tian and didn’t even mind using his Emperor’s Possession to fight Li Qiye. But before he could do anything, he was given a good beating by the old man with the paper hat.</p><p>As a disciple of an Immortal Emperor lineage, Jikong Jian felt superior to others. After he left the mountain, he had always carried a proud air with him, yet he was beaten down hard in front of everyone. Even though he could not afford to become enemies with that old man, he could antagonize the Nine Saint Demon Gate, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and even Li Qiye himself. Therefore, he put all of the blame on Li Qiye instead.</p><p>So when the Heavenly God Sect maneuvered against the Nine Saint Demon Gate, Jikong Jian joined the Heavenly God Sect’s camp to support Dao Child Sheng Tian without any hesitation.</p><p>“Bang--bang--bang!” At this moment, the experts from both sides fought from the ground all the way to the sky with godly swords swerving in the air, cutting through the earth. If Ancient Sky City had not been protected by generations of invincible characters, it would have been destroyed much earlier.</p><p>“Old Man Chi, you are now old and won’t do anymore!” On the side of the Heavenly God Sect, Wan Shengjian — with an unstoppable momentum — fought against the Nine Saint Demon Gate’s Chi Yun! Even though Chi Yun was one of the four Supreme Elders and also an experienced Ancient Saint, he couldn’t garner a glimmer of advantage against Wan Shengjian and was repeatedly pushed back!</p><p>“Open...” Elder Yun of the Nine Saint Demon Gate roared fiercely, wanting to break through with his most elite disciples, but he was deterred by the Heavenly God Sect elders.</p><p>This time, the Heavenly God Sect came prepared. Besides a peak Ancient Saint like Wan Shengjian, the Heavenly God Sect also had two other elders who joined the fray! They blocked Elder Yun’s path, rendering him incapable of breaking through the entrapment!</p><p>“Zhang--” On the other side, the sounds of swords continuously rang as dragon roars reached the heavens as well. The outbreak of Tu Buyu’s Enlightened Being strength with his Flying Dragon Sword had a battle intent capable of punishing the heavens itself. Each of his sword moves were completely fatal!</p><p>Seeing how fierce Tu Buyu was, not only the experts from the Heavenly God Sect, but many sect masters and royal lords along with Demon Monarchs standing to the side were astonished.</p><p>“Is that the War God Formula of the legends?” Seeing Tu Buyu taking action, a royal lord from the previous generation murmured: “An insect losing its one hundred legs still lives on; the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is indeed worthy of its Immortal Emperor lineage. After declining for so long, it still carries some emperor’s power!”</p><p>Even though Tu Buyu was nothing short of extraordinary, he still couldn’t change the grand scheme of things. He had to protect the group of Qu Daoli as well as help the Nine Saint Demon Gate’s disciples repel the enemy. His strength alone was insufficient to protect everyone. He led Qu Daoli, along with the young Nine Saint Demon Gate disciples, to break through the barricades several times without any success.</p><p>“Boom!” A decisively loud explosion resounded and the Heavenly Grotto of the Nine Saint Demon Gate couldn’t hold on any longer, ending in its demise! The screaming enemies broke through the entrance and charged into the Heavenly Grotto.</p><p>“Open the formation, set down the formation stone!” Chi Yun roaringly commanded. With his instructions, the Heavenly Grotto once again thrusted a bright ray forward as the Nine Saint Demon Gate disciples activated the formation stone once more. They added a huge amount of Refined Jades to repair the Heavenly Grotto’s damage. However, even this was not enough to make up for the losing situation as the Nine Saint Demon Gate continuously retreated.</p><p>“The Nine Saint Demon Gate has lost its morale ah! Unless there are reinforcements, they won’t be able to hold onto this resting area.” Seeing the breached Heavenly Grotto, a sect master lamented with a soft sigh.</p><p>“Isn’t the Nine Saint Demon Gate’s Goddess Li also at Ancient Sky City? What about that extremely arrogant Li Qiye? Didn’t he appear recently as well?” Seeing the Nine Saint Demon Gate losing their momentum, a cultivator asked in puzzlement.</p><p>Once Li Qiye was brought up, many people glanced at each other. This kid was so arrogant ah, and he even hectored Dao Child Sheng Tian before. Even someone of Dao Child Sheng Tian’s level had no choice but to kneel in public as he was forced to confess. How come this chaotically arrogant kid hasn’t appeared yet even at this point?</p><p>“The Nine Saint Demon Gate is only a minor sect, yet you still dare to be presumptuous.” At a time when everyone was silent, a bronze chariot appeared on top of the Nine Saint Demon Gate’s Heavenly Grotto.</p><p>An old man stood on top of the bronze chariot while exuding his extremely thick azure aura that hovered around his body like a dragon.</p><p>The bronze chariot below the old man was not pulled by flying beasts, but by four bronze stallions instead. The four bronze stallions were extremely vibrant. It was as if they were alive! Moreover, this bronze chariot was extremely ancient beyond antiquity.</p><p>This bronze chariot was designed for battle. Its body was covered with innumerable arrow holes and blade marks. Just a glance and one would immediately know that this chariot had been through countless battlefields!</p><p>A Coiling Dragon was carved to its right and a Godking was carved to the left. In the front was a Qilin and the back had a White Tiger. All of these beings had lost their colors and was bereft of the colors of life. They were nothing more than decorations at this point.</p><p>The old man surrounded by the azure energy who was standing on top of the mysterious bronze chariot was extremely mighty. Up high above while encompassing everyone, his imposing aura caught everything going on without missing a single thing.</p><p>“Qing Xuan Yuanhe...” The Turtle Monarch from the Flying Dragon Lake recognized this old man, and his expression greatly diminished as he uttered.</p><p>“Qing Xuan Yuanhe! The younger brother of the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom’s Mortal King!” Hearing this name, a Demon Monarch sect master of the last generation took in a deep breath and muttered.</p><p>“This is a Heaven Restoration Saint ah! Once he reaches Heavenly Sovereign, he would absolutely massacre any opponent of the same level!” Another Demon Monarch who knew Qing Xuan Yuanhe’s background struggled to let out these words.</p><p>The Ancient Saint realm was divided into the following from lowest to highest: Little Saint, Young Saint, and Grand Saint. The highest peak was an Ancient Saint and, once broken through, would mark the start of the Heavenly Sovereign realm.</p><p>However, cultivators at the Ancient Saint realm who had five Fate Palaces would be called Heaven Restoration Saints. This existence was much more frightening than a Grand Saint. For a Heaven Restoration Saint, even when their actual cultivation was only of the Little Saint level, they were still able to slay a Grand Saint!</p><p>At this point, many people secretly glanced at each other. A Heaven Restoration Saint like Qing Xuan Yuanhe personally presiding over this place was simply to help the Heavenly God Sect in this battle!</p><p>Everyone then understood that the Heavenly God Sect dared to accept the animosity of the world and attacked the Nine Saint Demon Gate’s Heavenly Grotto because they were full of confidence.</p><p>The Heavenly God Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate were both first-ranked great sects at the Grand Middle Territory. Both sides were very familiar in strength, and the Heavenly God Sect would not recklessly attack the Nine Saint Demon Gate for they were not certain of victory!</p><p>However, once it had the support of both the Space Trample Mountain along with the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, this was no longer the case! The Space Trample Mountain was the newest Immortal Emperor lineage, and its emperor’s power was still flourishing. Needless to say, the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom was a one sect, two emperors existence. Unless the War God Temple appeared, very few great sects and countries dared to oppose this Ancient Kingdom in the Grand Middle Territory!</p><p>“I’m afraid it is over for the Nine Saint Demon Gate in this era. They might be the second great sect after the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to fall.” Seeing Qing Xuan Yuanhe standing together with the Heavenly God Sect, a sect master’s heart sank and couldn’t help but to feel sympathy.</p><p>With two Immortal Emperor lineages helping them, especially one as monstrous as the Ancient Kingdom, the Heavenly God Sect’s fiery aura pierced the high heavens. As a new rising sect, it will surely develop continuously. Even if the Nine Saint Demon Gate opposed it, it would be as if they were seeking their own demise!</p><p>“Daring to oppose the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom — isn’t this just courting death!” Seeing Qing Xuan Yuanhe, the great sects and countries who had great relationships with the Nine Saint Demon Gate could only wait and see.</p><p>With Qing Xuan Yuanhe here, it meant that the Ancient Kingdom fully supported the Heavenly God Sect! Before, when the Nine Saint Demon Gate was in trouble, there were a few allies who wanted to help, but after seeing Qing Xuan Yuanhe, these sect masters and royal lords quickly dispelled this notion from their minds.</p><p>Although allies were very dear, becoming enemies with the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom was simply courting death and could even bring about a sect-destroying calamity. At such a key moment, it didn’t matter that they were allies, no one was willing to provoke a monstrous existence like the Ancient Kingdom just to assist the Nine Saint Demon Gate.</p><p>“I heard that that year at the Evil Infested Ridge, Li Qiye opposed Heavenly Prince Qing Xuan! Since the Nine Saint Demon Gate foolishly supports the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, how can the Ancient Kingdom spare them?” At this point, some people with hidden intentions purposely let out such a message in order to incite more uneasiness and chaos.</p><p>Hearing such gossip, a sect master changed his expression to say: “That Li boy is as bodacious as the heavens. He even dares to become enemies with the Ancient Kingdom; isn’t that just seeking his own death? This Cleansing Incense Ancient Gate, sigh, they’re not doing a good job of controlling its disciples. Such a black sheep should be expelled; otherwise, it will bring about a sect-destroying disaster!”</p><p>“What is so special about that Li brat? He only relies on Immortal Emperor Min Ren leaving behind Emperor’s Possessions to stroll arrogantly about. Hmph, the moment when there is a real fight, a junior like him only borrowing a tiger’s power is nothing more than a turtle with its head in its shell — not daring to come out.” When Li Qiye was brought up, countless young cultivators were annoyed, especially those who believed that they were the best. He was only a piece of trash yet was favored by Li Shuangyan and Chen Baojiao — this truly didn’t make any sense.</p><p>As some young prodigies saw that the Heavenly God Sect had the backing of the Space Trample Mountain along with the Ancient Kingdom, the thought that the Heavenly God Sect will surely flourish in the future surged. As such, they used this opportunity to say nice words about the Heavenly God Sect in order to please Dao Child Sheng Tian.</p><p>“Yeah, that brat is only living waste relying on Emperor’s Possessions to bluster. Without the Emperor’s weapon, he is nothing. How can a piece of trash like him have the qualifications to oppose Dao Child Sheng Tian? Pah, he is not even worthy of carrying Dao Child Sheng Tian’s shoes.” Younger cultivators wanted to suck up, so they spoke really loudly as if they were afraid that Dao Child Sheng Tian couldn’t hear them.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
