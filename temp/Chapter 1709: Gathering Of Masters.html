Old Xian and ancestors from the War God Temple, Bloodbull Godfiend, and masters from the Blood Race all came to say goodbye. After this trip, they wouldn’t be able to see their forefathers again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Old Xian and the godfiend were leaving with Li Qiye. The godfiend wasn’t alone since the four Primal Skymatrons came with him to come to the tenth world as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a reason for them to come, relating to the origin of their Blood Race and who their progenitor was.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed, more guests arrived at the sect. Visual phenomena continued to appear as if all the experts in the world were visiting.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a scene left many great powers envious. In the past, only an emperor would enjoy this grand treatment but now, Fiercest was experiencing it even though he wasn’t an emperor just yet. Of course, in Mortal Emperor, the two entities were virtually the same in everyone’s eyes already.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Madam Zi Yan and Yuan Caihe have arrived. Caihe brought a plethora of spirit herbs and grasses. Of course, Li Qiye returned the favor by giving her some of his own while imparting his lifelong alchemy skill to her. In the future, the war in the tenth world will be rough and they would need an Alchemy Emperor. Of course, she wasn’t one just yet but this was inevitable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye began a meeting with the godfiend, Old Xian, and South Emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will require your assistance this trip since I will be going on a different path.” Li Qiye told the group after sitting down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, you wish to go alone?” The godfiend was surprised.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye nodded: “Right, I have too many enemies up there. If you all follow me, you will be caught up in the crossfire and be hunted by a large group. If we split up instead, I can draw the majority of the enemies away. The juniors will need your protection. Your path won’t be easy either but I trust in your power.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The ascension participants will be subjected to the suppression of the heaven and earth. We don’t have the Heaven’s Will so this suppression might be even stronger.” Old Xian expressed his concern.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye agreed: “That’s true since not just anyone could come to the tenth. Don’t worry about this, I will force a path open and the suppression won’t be anything. I’ll flatten the way for your group, just worry about the hunt up there. That will be your biggest obstacle.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The older two became tense but South Emperor laughed instead: “Fine, let us witness the might of the emperors and gods up there then. It’ll come either way.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was young and vigorous compared to the other two. Of course, his exceptional talents were not something Old Xian and the godfiend could match.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You three will be supporting the main combatants at the vanguard.” Li Qiye said: “Someone else will do it because you will be facing existences at the emperor level. The risk of dying is too high for you three.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-092a"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye was going to let the golden dragon and tyrant tiger under Hidden-Dragon Mountains lead the way. Only characters like them could truly face the enemies who had the power of the Heaven’s Will.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-092a">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three had no objection and weren’t offended. After all, they couldn’t be arrogant against foes wielding the Heaven’s Will and could only try their best.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, your responsibilities are still heavy, everyone’s safety.” Li Qiye emphasized.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, we will do our best to not let you down.” The group solemnly said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmmm, I know that you can do so.” Li Qiye nodded: “Old Xian, your High Heaven Manual has unfathomable power. After cultivating for so long, you should be one with it and should be able to fight against them without losing too badly, just not a particularly powerful one.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope so.” Old Xian nodded. The manual mentioned here was the thing Li Qiye wanted to borrow from their War God Temple.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bloodbull’s weapon might be a bit inferior, but not by much. It has been in your possession for so long, I’m sure you can exert its power.” Li Qiye told the godfiend.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s nothing compared to our progenitor’s mastery.” The godfiend humbly answered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is only one Blood Progenitor in this world, he can take on anyone up there.&nbsp;It’s understandable that you’re not on his level right now.” Li Qiye smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took another glance at the group and said: “Outside of this, I have another request.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sacred Teacher, what would you like us to do? Just say the words.” South Emperor smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye spoke: “Very simple but it won’t be easy to carry out. I need all of you to work together to kill me, actually kill me!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill you?!” The three were shocked and glanced at each other in confusion. They thought they have misheard him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uh, Your Excellency, you want us to kill you?” Even the experienced godfiend had a strange expression on his face.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, kill me.” Li Qiye confirmed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not easy, Sacred Teacher.” South Emperor smiled wryly while shaking his head: “Not to mention that you’re unkillable under your thirteen palaces, we might be crushed before your four physiques.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s why I created a painless way to die without hurting my dao foundation. It is very suitable for this situation.” Li Qiye smirked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three exchanged glance again. In history, Li Qiye might be the only one who had created a method to die. No one would really believe this story if it was to spread out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the next days, Li Qiye was quite busy. They needed meticulous preparation before going to the tenth world. Li Qiye didn’t only create a huge ship but also let experts like the godfiend, Old Xian, and Allpine Treefather fight each other. This was so that they could get used to each other and foster better teamwork. This would, in turn, give them a higher chance of survival up there.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he also began the process of killing himself. He didn’t only want to go to the tenth world but also used this opportunity to deliver a great blow to those up there.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was aware that when he caused a big stir while going up, the emperors and gods up there would know that the Dark Crow was about to come again and not alone this time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So many people hated him up there and wanted nothing more than to flay him. Thus, the moment they found out about his ascension, they would crazily hunt him in a relentless manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a rare opportunity for him since it wasn’t easy to have so many emperors and gods gather together. If Li Qiye didn’t dig a hole for them, he would feel sorry that all of them have come such a long way to see him. Thus, he was planning to let them pay a great price and wishing to bathe in their blood. This was a way for him to establish his prestige once more and using them to tell the other overlords in the tenth world that the Dark Crow has returned.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to make his intention and determination of sweeping everything in his path as clear as possible to the lords above, to let them know of the terrible end awaiting those who stood in his way.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He certainly knew that these overlords wouldn’t compromise so easily, especially someone like the old geezer with the last name Qian. This old man would definitely want to take him on to the death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this didn’t really matter to him. This trip was his triumphant return and his victory was assured, even if he must make mountains of bones and rivers of blood. No one could stop his million years of planning! In short, he must be successful in this generation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wouldn’t show mercy to Old Qian and would even massacre the guy’s clan. He wouldn’t show mercy just because of Qian Suyun.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was either success or die trying for him in this generation. He would never let that event in the future happen!</span></p><div id="footnote-092a"><p>1. Chapter 964 <a href="#footnote-ref-092a"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p></div>
