The attack was ferocious and contained a force that could penetrate all things. Experts and deities would tremble before this attack from an Apex Godking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the spectators outside knew that this attack was aiming for Li Qiye and not them, they still felt a chill by their throats as if it was trying to pierce through them. They wanted to gasp, but there was no air. This was a very uncomfortable feeling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weaker cultivators fell down to the ground because this strike had enveloped this area. They couldn’t withstand this pressure and saw a vision of death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” Sparks went flying. This spear was indeed incredible, but Li Qiye stopped it with a saber in his left hand. The Benevolent Saber emitted a brilliance that jumped around on its blade, making it seem alive.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This immortal light made the edge as bright as snow. It looked just like a moon illuminating the entire area.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a majestic figure within the immortal light. It stood there as if it was ushering in a new age. It could sever the past and reach the future. No darkness in this world could hide from this figure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Immortal Emperor Min Ren!” A knowledgeable paragon from the previous generation murmured and recognized the background of Li Qiye’s saber.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smart experts gasped after seeing the true treasure seemingly coming back to life. Anyone could wield a true treasure, but unleashing its imperial power was a different story. The weaker ones would be completely depleted after attacking with the weapon once or twice.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only experts who were sufficiently strong could wield these true treasures. However, this saber in Li Qiye’s hand was full of life as its imperial aura engulfed the world in just a moment. Without a doubt, this saber under his control could easily unleash an invincible imperial attack!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Keep in mind that even Godkings might not be able to wake these weapons because their awakening also meant gaining their recognition to a certain extent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This awakened state meant that the weapon was at its strongest level. A peak-condition true treasure unleashing an imperial attack was much different from an attack of a dormant true treasure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” The white general’s blood energy soared to the sky without holding anything back. It surged like a flood that spread across the world. His spear became even stronger and emitted a torrential light. With his support, the spear tried to suppress Li Qiye with an unstoppable force.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no doubt that the white general deserved his fame. As an Apex Godking, he could use his own power to stop a true treasure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The saber erupted during the first exchange. Boundless immortal light shot to the sky. The imperial power within frantically exploded as if an emperor had awakened and arrived at the scene.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The erupting saber didn’t only blow the general and his spear away, it also destroyed all the ice chains on Li Qiye’s body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the ice entrapping Yonghuang shattered, allowing her to escape.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” The general rose up again after being blown away. His spear unleashed a torrential barrage with loud blasts.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked as if comets were falling down from the sky. Each thrust could wreck a mountain.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The hymn of a saber echoed across the realms. The Benevolent Saber in the sky made everything else seem dark in comparison. With one slash, the only thing that remained was its white-as-snow brilliance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nowhere in the world to hide from this attack. All darkness instantly vanished into smoke.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first slash of three, Pacifistic Brilliance. This blade alone illuminated the nine heavens and ten earths. The world needed nothing more than just this slash.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The saber itself had peerless strength, not to mention it was in its peak form. This attack seemed as if the emperor himself was performing the slash and could definitely decapitate a Godking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The white general was blown away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eat another one!” Li Qiye soared to the sky and gave chase while unleashing another blade straight at the general.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This particular slash had no variations and profundities, it only had the will of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. Under his will, no existence in this world could resist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merciful Wisdom — the second slash from the Benevolent Saber. This slash contained the emperor’s will. Everything became extraordinary and supreme.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This one slash had turned into a peerless grand dao. At this moment, everything disappeared in this saber dao, leaving only the emperor’s will behind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His will was unquestionable and could order the world. Because of this, many cultivators outside the valley couldn’t stand straight and kneeled on the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white general didn’t back down. He crazily roared and revealed his Godking’s rings. They came out and formed their own world. Each halo carried an Apex Dao. At this moment, he was standing at the pinnacle of the dao and even broke through its limits.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon roars continuously resounded. In this split second, his spear looked just like a true dragon coiling in the sky. Its draconic aura surged with the formation of a domain. Draconic runes as large as mountains floated within this domain.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, his spear had opened its draconic domain for protection against the emperor’s will.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was one of his strongest attacks. He wouldn’t resort to it unless there was no other choice.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A bit interesting, have another.” Li Qiye laughed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” His vitality erupted. The saber let out a long hymn and seemed to be transforming. It was no longer a simple weapon as it has gained its own life force!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The world became clear after this slash came out. Everything became brilliant yet ethereal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Benevolent Lucidity — the final slash.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under its power, all questions in the nine worlds ceased to exist. No profundity in myriad realms was worth discussing. The mysteries and secrets of the grand dao were done for. Even ancient rumors were easily understood. All became obvious before the might of this slash.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was not just a slash but an answer to the grand dao of the world. Even the white general’s defensive technique turned vulnerable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, it seemed as if the Benevolent Saber was grasped by the emperor’s left hand instead of Li Qiye’s.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just imagine the power of this strike from an emperor himself. An Apex Godking was nothing before its might!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat!” Even Zhentian was shocked by this saber’s power. He instantly entered the valley with incomparable speed. He grasped the universe and took control of the grand dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a loud bang, an extremely long path appeared between Li Qiye and the white general.
