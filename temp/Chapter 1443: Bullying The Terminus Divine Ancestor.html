Mu Yueli — what a difficult name to forget. They had experienced a lot back then, so it was time for him to face the music.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the future, he needed to visit the end of the world. This might be a path of no return, so he needed to settle all grudges and matters of the past.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will you really go and see her?” Xiaoxiao found this surprising: “Rumor has it that after she adopted a secluded lifestyle, no one has been able to see her face to face.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye only chuckled at her skepticism and didn’t reply.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The trio arrived at the Divine Tree Ridge once more and visited the citadel. This whole area was currently bustling. One could see cultivators everywhere among the pretty peaks and deep valleys.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The culprit was the news of the immortal medicine. After this news spread out, everyone tried to find the medicine. Many experienced cultivators and alchemists headed for the Divine Tree Ridge right away because this was the most likely location for this immortal medicine to appear.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, the normally desolate terrain of this place was full of people. Even though they knew that it was quite dangerous, especially the deeper locations with the risk of seeds turning them into withered, they still chose to continue their search. This was a chance to make a fortune, even if they couldn’t use it for themselves. Selling it to someone else meant that they could live the rest of their lives in peace.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The trio’s arrival at the ridge immediately attracted a lot of eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fierce is here.” Someone couldn’t help but shout after seeing Li Qiye in the distance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye was currently extremely notorious across the world. Anyone who heard his name would quiver inside. They quickly made way for him. Wherever he went would become quiet since no one dared to gossip about him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he destroyed Zhentian’s avatar, many put him on the same level as Zhentian. Among the younger generation, both the Seashield Prince and the Seven Martial Goddess were put one level lower than him in terms of fame.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, Ego King, I didn’t realize you are now so famous and awe-inspiring.” Xiaoxiao noticed the quiet atmosphere and revealed a charming smile after giving Li Qiye a side-glance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, she was the only one who would dare to talk to Li Qiye in such a nonchalant manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye leisurely responded: “An invincible person like me should indeed be awe-inspiring.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please, enough with the boasting. When it comes to compliments, you’ll want a mile after getting an inch.” Xiaoxiao stared at him with disdain: “You can be happy all you want right now. Wait until after I become an invincible treefather, the first thing I’ll do is take you down completely so that you can never get up again.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, the little girl aggressively postured with both hands on her waist as if she was about to suppress Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He simply smiled and shook his head after seeing this: “Even if you become an invincible treefather, no, even if you become an Immortal Emperor, you can only be pressed down before me.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bah! What a shameless pervert!” She looked at him with fierce eyes as if she wanted to kill him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little girl, where did your mind run off to? Stop thinking about those things when you are so young, focus on cultivation instead.” He mocked her with a grin after hearing her strange response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to kill you, Ego King!” She became angry like a cat that had its tail stepped on and immediately lunged at him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed and continued forward at a faster pace.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long before the trio reached the Divine Tree Citadel. They didn’t enter just yet since the sky-blotting Terminus Ancestor opened his eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Terminus looked at Xiaoxiao and said: “Young Miss, congratulations, congratulations. The path to the grand dao has been opened for you. In the future, the treants will shine because of you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you.” Xiaoxiao naturally knew what he was referring to and felt quite excited.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you need anything at the citadel, come and find me.” Terminus happily laughed. He was already a heaven-defying character, and he only grew stronger after taking root here.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, even if a Godking or someone like Meng Zhentian personally came, he wouldn’t give them the time of day. However, he held Xiaoxiao in a good light. If it wasn’t for Li Qiye, he would have made her his disciple instantly and personally became her dao protector to watch her turn into an unstoppable treefather.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She tilted her head to the side and mused before asking: “I can find you for anything?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. As long as it is within my capabilities, anything is fine.” Terminus laughed again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, I do have something to trouble you with.” Her pretty eyes beautifully blinked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Terminus cheerfully replied: “Let’s hear it.” He was clearly spoiling her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s very simple.” Xiaoxiao smiled and pointed at Li Qiye: “Help me take this Ego King down and force him to submit. Hmph, we’ll see if he can still be all arrogant then!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Er…” Terminus didn’t say anything since he didn’t expect this type of request from her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you with this.” He eventually let out a wry smile and gently moved his face back and forth. He naturally knew who he was facing. Even if he wanted to, he lacked the ability.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, you just told me to find you for anything, but now you changed your mind?” She pouted and was clearly unhappy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anything outside of this.” Terminus showed an embarrassed expression: “I can take charge of anything else at the Divine Tree Ridge.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t want anything else but this.” Xiaoxiao then murmured: “I just want to see the Ego King be suppressed.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gently knocked on her forehead and smiled: “How can there be no other things? You can ask him about where the immortal medicine is and ask for his help to get it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, right.” Xiaoxiao’s eyes lit up with sparkles.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Terminus looked quite bitter after hearing this, but he maintained his wry smile: “Young Noble, you have everything at your disposal so you know better than anyone else whether the ridge has a medicine for immortality or not. The nine worlds are only secular places, how could there be a medicine for eternal life? This only stemmed from some baseless and foolish rumors.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There really isn’t a medicine for eternal life?” Xiaoxiao was curious about the topic since she had been hearing about it after coming to Godhalt.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really.” Terminus shook his head again: “How could there be this level of medicine in the nine worlds? If it does exist, Immortal Emperors would have taken it away already, it wouldn’t be the turn of those foolish ones.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao felt that Terminus didn’t need to lie to her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled and added: “There probably isn’t any medicine for immortality. However, I personally know that there is an amazing divine medicine in the Divine Tree Ridge. Alas, my memories are still vague, I believe it might be at something something valley.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well…” Terminus let out a hollow laugh: “I don’t know much about this either because the Divine Tree Ridge is so large.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so?” Li Qiye grinned: “You have taken root here for a long time now, yet something like this can elude you?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Noble, you are too funny.” Terminus quickly laughed again: “I am only a little tree with limited abilities. The land under my jurisdiction is also very little. The Divine Tree Ridge is one of the twelve burial grounds, and it is too mysterious. My foolish self can’t even grasp a tiny bit of it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Terminus spoke very modestly at this moment since he didn’t dare to show the slightest bit of arrogance in front of Li Qiye. Under normal circumstances, even Godkings would have to lower themselves before him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye only smiled. He didn’t continue to tease him. After all, he wasn’t omnipotent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goodbye.” Xiaoxiao waved at Terminus as they headed for the citadel. Li Qiye intended to find a place for the two girls to stay so that he could go and see someone. Before he could arrange for their accommodations, however, he was stopped along the way.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streets in the citadel were vast, yet they were immediately stopped at this crossroad. A large number of experts completely surrounded them.</span></p>
