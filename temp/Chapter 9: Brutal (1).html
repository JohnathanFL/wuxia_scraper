<p>The next day, Li Qiye woke up and immediately asked if Nan Huairen wanted to go on another sight-seeing tour. He wanted to see if there was anything left from his era lying around.</p><p>Nan Huairen did not want to go at all. It didn’t matter whether Li Qiye was crazy or stupid, his intuition told him that Li Qiye would definitely cause trouble; going with him was simply masochistic.</p><p>Unfortunately, Li Qiye already turned around and began his trip around the sect. Nan Huairen had no choice but to follow him. The most important event during this trip was the marriage trial. If something actually happened to Li Qiye, he wouldn’t be able to escape unscathed.</p><p>However, not long after their departure, they were surrounded by Du Yuanguang and his outer disciple friends. These disciples didn’t see eye-to-eye with Li Qiye. With Du Yuanguang leading the way, it was a wondrous opportunity to teach this arrogant bastard a lesson.</p><p>“Ah, it is Brother Du, I have heard of your great reputation long ago.” Nan Huairen knew that trouble was coming, but he still kept his calm and friendliness.</p><p>Du Yuanguang only gave Nan Huairen a short glance and said: “Nan Huairen, you don’t have any business here. Move to the side or we’ll deal with you as well.”</p><p>Nan Huairen’s expression darkened, but he knew that the strong ate the weak. Thus, he slightly bowed and asked: “Brother Du, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>Du Yuanguang completely ignored Nan Huairen this time around. He gave an icy cold look toward Li Qiye that was full of killing intent.</p><p>With his usual carefree attitude, Li Qiye stepped forward towards Du Yuanguang and said: “A smart dog does not block the road. If you don’t want to be a dog, then get out of my way.”</p><p>After he heard this, Nan Huairen knew that everything was ruined. Especially when he saw the thirst for blood in Du Yuanguang’s eyes, he knew that this would not end without conflict.</p><p>An angry disciple yelled out: “Do you not want to live? The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect no longer has the qualifications to be considered an Immortal Emperor lineage. You dare to jump around like a clown in front of us? A mere ant dares to be disrespectful?”</p><p>Li Qiye was ready to retort, but Nan Huairen quickly stopped him and whispered: “Forget about it, First Brother. Don’t worry about them. Du Yuanguang is an outer disciple that is getting a lot of attention. He is also the latest disciple of Protector Hua. If he passes the yearly examination, he will immediately become an inner disciple.”</p><p>Nan Huairen’s intention was to remind Li Qiye that they could not afford to antagonize someone like Du Yuanguang. He had the support of a protector from the Nine Saint Demon Gate. A protector in this sect had a higher standing than an elder of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>Du Yuanguang did not make a move, he only coldly said: “We of the Nine Saint Demon Gate rule the Old Ox Country. Even if you are from a small sect, you are still a guest; we would like to treat you with the minimum courtesy befitting our status. However, one of my brothers has recently lost a treasure — this is not a common occurrence in our honorable sect.”</p><p>Nan Huairen’s complexion sank as he started to panic: “Brother Du, what is the meaning of your words?”</p><p>Du Yuanguang glanced over at Li Qiye and said: “In the last two days, there were no other guests besides the people from your sect.”</p><p>Du Yuanguang clearly implied that the thief was from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This matter did not only affect one person because it also greatly influences the reputation of an entire sect. Even someone as wily as Nan Huairen couldn’t help but show an ugly expression.</p><p>“Brother Du, please watch what you say!” Nan Huairen wanted to treat this matter diplomatically, but it now concerned the reputation of his own sect. He would not stand for such insults.</p><p>“Watch what I say? Your sect is desolate and as poor as a beggar, who could guarantee that a thief did not infiltrate your sect? Your prime disciple is just a piece of trash, so to say that your sect recruited thieves would not be unreasonable.”</p><p>Nan Huairen’s face reddened with rage. As a person who truly cared for his sect, he could not stand for this mockery, so he replied: “Brother Du, we want to meet with Sectional Leader Fu of your sect. No matter what happens, we demand an answer from your sect regarding this baseless accusation.”</p><p>Du Yuanguang exploded in laughter for a while before he confidently replied: “Meet Sectional Leader Fu? Nan Huairen, it's not that I don’t want to reserve some dignity for you, but you and this trash do not have the qualifications to request a meeting with Sectional Leader Fu. Our sectional leaders are capable of being bestowed the title of Named Hero, and it is unknown whether your elders are capable of the same feat. Maybe your elders are qualified to meet with Sectional Leader Fu, but you and this trash? Don’t even think about it.”</p><p>After he finished his speech, Du Yuanguang coldly stared at Li Qiye. The other disciples clapped in agreement and started to taunt Li Qiye with nasty words again.</p><p>Nan Huairen was shaking from anger, but Li Qiye maintained his composure and carefully retorted: “To me, it doesn't matter if this plan stems from you, the leader, or even your protector. To be frank, it is because you are smitten with your senior; I think her name was Li Shuangyan? Even though I have never seen her before, you are too petty. The engagement of your prime descendant, Li Shuangyan, is merely a one-sided affair. Because I respect your sect’s current status, I would consider having her as a maid.”</p><p>“And as for you?” Li Qiye continued: “You are too naive. If your goddess had such talents, she wouldn't put you in her sight. I already don’t care for her, so why would you try to compete with me for her like a fool? Get out of the way, you should find a place with shade and take a break to cool off your hot head.”</p><p>“You bastard! If you want to die this badly, I’ll gladly show you to your death!” Du Yuanguang, enraged by those words, summoned his sword as well as his aura.</p><p>“Du Yuanguang, if you want to fight, I will not turn a blind eye.” Having witnessed Li Qiye’s bravery, Nan Huairen, who was burning with rage, felt a lot better. However, he knew that Li Qiye had never cultivated before, so he immediately stood guard in front of him.</p><p>“Fine, I will take care of you first, then I’ll kill the little bastard!” Fiery anger was being exuded from Du Yuanguang's eyes. To him, Li Shuangyan was an untouchable goddess, yet Li Qiye dared to insult her.</p><p>Li Qiye slowly pushed Nan Huairen back and calmly said: “Huairen, if someone wants to take my life, I’ll be the one to put an end to him. You should stand back and watch.”</p><p>“Good! Good! Excellent!” Du Yuanguang was no longer angry and instead burst out into laughter: “This is the funniest thing I have ever heard. A piece of trash like you wants to kill someone who is at the Provisional Palace stage like me? So be it, I will give you a chance to fight!”</p><p>Knowing that he was a mortal, everyone knew that Li Qiye could not use any merit laws. The other disciples pitied Li Qiye: “Martial techniques versus merit laws? You don’t even know the basics, yet your arrogance is through the roof. It is such a pity.”</p><p>Li Qiye could not be bothered by such comments. He calmly stated: “That is fine, everyone can witness this battle.” With that said, he walked towards the battle stage.</p><p>“You can’t!” Nan Huairen was filled with fear. He grabbed Li Qiye and said: “First Brother! This is impossible! Du Yuanguang has reached the pinnacle of the Provisional Palace stage. You cannot be his match.”</p><p>“It's fine, he's only at Provisional Palace and not Royal Noble! And even if a Royal Noble of the Nine Saint Demon Gate dares to mess with me, I would mince him into tiny pieces all the same depending on my mood.”</p><p>Li Qiye lightly smirked then pushed Nan Huairen away.</p><p>Nan Huairen’s head started to hurt. His first thought was that his first brother had gone senile. Li Qiye had only joined the sect for a few days and had yet to begin practicing even the most basic of cultivation techniques. He only had access to the “Invisible Dual Blades” martial technique.</p><p>A person who only practiced martial arts could not fight against a cultivator. Comparing martial techniques to merit laws was the same as comparing the heaven and earth. Not to mention, Du Yuanguang was also an expert at the Provisional Palace stage.</p><p>Nan Huairen regained his wits and immediately went to find his master, Protector Mo. He knew that if this fight takes place, only death would be the result.</p>
