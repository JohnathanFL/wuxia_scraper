Even though his face still had a youthful innocence, his forehead showed signs of a seasoned maturity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The boy was born in a very small village consisting of only several dozen families. His ancestors have all been good-natured farmers in this village.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was lost in thoughts while gazing at the cold rain that helps him forget about the past. Upon his birth was also the death of his mother while his father succumbed to the toil of life when he was eight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, he had three decent farm plots on top of the occasional assistance from his neighbors. This allowed him to barely have clothes and a full stomach.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the age of dreams and fantasy. Despite making just enough to eat, he still had his own dreams during this rain watch.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He dreamed of the day when he could become an immortal, freed from sadness and worries, dressed with golden robes and satiated with wondrous meals, a life of freedom while soaring through the heaven and earth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He has heard the adults talk about immortals before. One hundred miles away from the village was a divine mountain with a sect called Southern Creek. Within were immortals capable of doing all the things he yearned about.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes lit up whenever he thought about them with an unquenchable ambition for cultivation. This was because two days ago, an amazing immortal came to Wu Qi’s house. He rode the clouds and trod on the winds then descended from the sky. After his visit, he took Wu Qi in as a disciple.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This immortal was called the Purepine Ancient Saint, a big character from a faraway immortal sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Qi grew up together with Ye Yunzhou. They were extremely close so Yunzhou was very happy for Wu Qi.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A chilling breeze blew by causing Yunzhou to shudder. He calmed down and looked up to see that the roof of his house was leaking water. He had to slightly shift to the side.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his father was still around, his house had two rooms and one hallway but one room has collapsed now, leaving behind his own leaky room.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His belly rumbled. It was another night of hunger as the boy reached into his dried food pouch. There was not much left so he had to swallow his saliva and endure this hunger to save it. When the rain ended, he could go find other food.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Suddenly, a dark shadow rushed in through the window. It was a dark crow that decided to land on the string by his bed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crow shook its body causing water to spray everywhere. Yunzhou had to dodge and couldn’t do anything about the little bird.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has been staying at his place for several days now with no fear of strangers. It nonchalantly treated this place as its home.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After coming inside, the crow didn’t bother looking at Yunzhou at all. It lowered its head into its feathers and seemed to be sleeping.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You couldn’t find any food outside?” The boy asked softly. He has grown familiar with this intruder taking his room for its own and felt that this was how it should be.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the morning, the crow would leave and didn’t return until now. Yunzhou actually thought that it wasn’t coming back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crow had no reaction and ignored the boy completely without moving its body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing the crow’s dispirited appearance, he reached into his dried food pouch and salivated. After a moment of hesitation, he still took some food out and placed it before the crow to say: “Eat this if you are hungry. I still have some left.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crow still buried its head in its feathers and didn’t care for the boy. He was surprised for a bit and felt that it was quite funny. Why was he trying to talk to a crow that wouldn’t understand him in the first place?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I forgot, how can you know what I’m saying? You’re just a crow.” He smiled wryly and scratched his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the crowd suddenly lifted its head and stared coldly at him. His smile froze after seeing this peering gaze. This crow seemed to be able to understand him!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He found it inconceivable like in a dream. A crow capable of understanding humans. No one would ever believe this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, he showed the food on his palm again and said: “Do, do you want to eat?” He wasn’t certain of his hunch.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the crow ignored him and resumed the resting position inside its feathers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt as if he saw a look of contempt in the crow as if it was high and mighty and wouldn’t stoop down to eat his dried ration.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I, I must be dreaming.” He pinched his face and murmured.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being scorned by the crow, he went back to his spot and sat down with both hands hugging his knees while staring at the crow.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of crow was this? Could it really understand humans or was it just his illusion? In this short period, the boy let his imagination run wild.</span></p>
