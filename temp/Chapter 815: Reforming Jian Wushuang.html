<p><b>Chapter 815: Reforming Jian Wushuang</b></p><p>Any cultivator with some power or wealth would not pick a destiny stone with only one heavenly accumulation! Stones of this grade were considered cheap and useless. Even ordinary cultivators wouldn’t pick one of these, let alone Jian Wushuang who came from an imperial lineage.</p><p>“Like I said, there is no good or bad for destiny stones, only their suitability.” Li Qiye added: “In the past, Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan was an invincible existence that swept through myriad realms.”</p><p>“How many Immortal Emperor Bu Zhans can there be in this world?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but make this comment. In fact, she had heard her seniors in the Jian Clan talk about him before. However, they did not emphasize the tale because the legend of Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan definitely couldn’t be duplicated.</p><p>“You!” Li Qiye gazed at Jian Wushuang and declared: “You will be the second Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan! Remember well, the sole bow to reach the extreme, the lone arrow to reach the zenith — this will allow you to surpass your forefather and become someone who can challenge Immortal Emperors. Otherwise, you will never be able to escape his shadow!”</p><p>Jian Wushuang contemplated Li Qiye’s words. She truly wanted to tread on the path unfinished by Immortal Emperor Diyi Jian. Back then, when the emperor failed to prove his dao using the bow, it became his biggest regret! If Jian Wushuang wanted to continue the path from where her forefather left off, she indeed needed to change.</p><p>However, this was easier said than done. A destiny stone with one heavenly accumulation replacing a nine accumulations stone… Moreover, it required scraping her existing true fate weapon and starting from scratch. Only a madman would even consider such a thing.</p><p>However, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and formally accepted the suggestion: “Okay, I will change! As long as it will be a better pairing with the Nine Words True Bow, I am willing to do so!”</p><p>The decision for such a sacrifice was not easy to make for Jian Wushuang.</p><p>“This determination is necessary to reach the peak!” Li Qiye praised. Despite her arrogance, she was brilliant in that she was able to back up her words.</p><p>“What else do you want me to do?” She threw caution to the wind after having made up her mind. She would tread this path to the very end!</p><p>Li Qiye replied in a serious manner: “Second, I want you to change your longevity treasure. I want your blood energy and longevity blood to maximize the power of your arrows!”</p><p>This shocked her a second time despite mentally preparing herself. This wasn’t something she could easily accept. First he wanted her to change her true fate weapon, and now he wanted her to change her longevity treasure. This was starting over from the beginning in the truest sense.</p><p>“I know your longevity treasure is amazing. The Jian Clan has expended a lot of effort and thoughts on you.” Li Qiye dismissively said: “However, I will repeat the same thing again. If you want to challenge emperors or even slay them, you must change!”</p><p>Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and slightly gritted her teeth before answering: “Very well, I will change. What kind of longevity treasure do you want me to use? I will tell my father to prepare what’s necessary!”</p><p>“No, I already have one prepared.” Li Qiye gently shook his head. Back in the Beast Vein, he had massacred countless monsters, so he had a large quantity of life rings, longevity blood, and beast marrow.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll change both of them then!” Jian Wushuang nodded. This required great determination and perseverance. Others would surely think that she was crazy right now.</p><p>Li Qiye solemnly said: “We’ll change your true treasure first. The changing of your longevity treasure can wait a bit. I’m afraid you won’t be able to handle both at the same time since this is a complete redo.”</p><p>Li Qiye pulled out all the stops for Jian Wushuang. He only had one goal — to train an invincible general under his banner! Even though Jian Wushuang didn’t have unparalleled talents nor was she the strongest, Li Qiye took note of her fearless heart, boundless confidence, matchless arrogance, and especially her heart that stood undaunted by failure and even death! This was exactly what he was looking for!</p><p>“Outside of the treasures, is there anything else I need to change?” Jian Wushuang didn’t care about anything anymore. Since she was already changing the treasures, what else was off the table?</p><p>“I want you to refine a physique law.” Li Qiye said: “In the future, I want you to rely on this physique to make your archery unfathomably stronger!”</p><p>“My physique is only an ordinary one.” Jian Wushuang shook her head: “I’m afraid there won’t be a suitable law for it.”</p><p>“Don’t you worry, I have prepared everything for you. You are not someone who is aiming for a saint or immortal physique, you’re just aiming for a supreme dao of archery. Thus, I will not pass down any immortal physiques to you.” Li Qiye said.</p><p>“Then let’s begin.” Jian Wushuang agreed. Cultivating a new physique was no big deal at this point.</p><p>Li Qiye nodded: “We’ll have to first refine this physique then change your true weapon. Once your true weapon takes form, we’ll switch to the longevity treasure. Trust me, only at the apex of the bow would you be able to challenge Immortal Emperors and maybe even kill them!”</p><p>“I’ll leave the arrangements to you. Just give me the conditions and I’ll fulfill them.” Jian Wushuang responded with confidence.</p><p>Li Qiye taught her a new physique law. Of course, it also stemmed from the Physique Scripture. However, it was not an immortal or saint physique, it was only a Houtian physique.</p><p>Houtian physiques were nothing special in the eyes of many people. It wasn’t even considered a real physique law. However, this houtian law from Li Qiye was not ordinary due to its origin!</p><p>Of course, this was not Li Qiye’s attempt of getting her to create an invincible body to use it to crush all of her enemies. This physique was merely to complement her archery, to take it to an even higher level by exerting the most powerful force!</p><p>Her talents were great and she also had a solid foundation, so it was incredibly easy for her to learn a houtian physique. After Li Qiye passed on the incantation, she only took several short days before achieving some results. During this process, Li Qiye was preparing a physique paste for her to temper her body.</p><p>All was ready. Li Qiye summoned the pentagate to seal the room with only him and Jian Wushuang inside. Li Qiye took out all the materials and the Myriad Heavenly Cauldron to begin the boiling process!</p><p>“What kind of physique paste is this?” Jian Wushuang was surprised after seeing all the materials. Although she was not an alchemist, she still had an understanding about paste formulas.</p><p>Li Qiye shook his head: “I am going to make you extraordinary, so this is no common formula. Moreover, the common pastes were created by the Alchemy God to spread to the rest of the world. Your paste is different from these common pastes as it will have three different tempering acts. Each tempering will be different from the others.”</p><p>She carefully identified these medicines. All were treasures of the world, and many of which were ones she had never seen before.</p><p>“A three million year old Calmstream Turtle’s marrow — this is the calmest and most righteous type of marrow. It’s even combined with an old root of a Soldier Tree several million years old. There’s also some juice of a Violetblood Ginseng Ancestor and some young leaves from a Bewildering Bamboo…” After noticing her careful examination and confusion, Li Qiye introduced them with a smile.</p><p>After hearing these names, even an arrogant person like her took a deep breath and stammered: “These… these are legendary immortal medicines...”</p><p>“That’s right, some of them are indeed immortal medicines.” Li Qiye gently nodded as if there was nothing special about it.</p><p>“Why are you being so nice to me?” Jian Wushuang was dazed for a moment. Even her clan wouldn’t be able to gather this batch of medicines together!</p><p>Even if an imperial lineage could do so, it wouldn’t give it to a junior. This particular batch could be considered supreme. Using this for the first body tempering was too wasteful.</p><p>Although it was said that she was working for Li Qiye, the harsher way to put it was that they were master and servant. She could understand the Jian Clan treating her well because she was the jewel of the family. However, she couldn’t believe Li Qiye’s great treatment towards her.</p><p>“Miss, don’t get me wrong.” Li Qiye laughed in response: “It isn’t that I like or love you or anything. I only hope that it will be worth spending all of this on you. In the future, I want to see you being able to embody 'see god, slay god, see devil, slay devil'. Where my war banner points is where you shall attack. Do you dare to achieve this?”</p><p>“Yes, what is there to be afraid of!” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and replied with a sonorous tone. At this second, she found herself a new goal. It was as if she could see a grand scene with thunderous storms as she destroyed the sky, signaling an apocalypse!</p><p>“Very good!” Li Qiye gently nodded: “One day you shall come to understand that slaying immortals is not impossible!”</p><p>Jian Wushuang’s blood was boiling. Prior to this, she assumed that by pledging loyalty to Li Qiye, she would only be helping him kill a few enemies. It was now different, she could sense how greatly he valued her and that he wished to train her into an invincible general!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
