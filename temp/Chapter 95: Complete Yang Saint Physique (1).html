<p>Her beautiful eyes gazed intensely at Li Qiye in astonishment, and she gravely said: “Who on earth are you?”</p><p>The Solar Immortal Physique was not passed down by Immortal Emperor Min Ren. Even inside the Su Clan, it was a big secret.</p><p>“You should know that I am a disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, your disciple, Li Qiye.” Li Qiye calmly smiled.</p><p>Su Yonghuang’s eyes became chilling. Her gaze became as sharp as a sword. It was as if invisible blades were approaching one’s body, causing others to fidget.</p><p>However, Li Qiye was still leisurely sitting there. He shook his head and said: “Don’t make a move against me. Coming from the Su Clan, I know that you are truly powerful. However, inside the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, if I want to kill you, it would be easier than killing an ant. I believe that Young Brother Tu has told you about my matters.”</p><p>After a while, Su Yonghuang finally withdrew the coldness in her gaze.</p><p>Li Qiye looked at her for a very long time. Finally, he gently shook his head and said: “The Solar Immortal Physique stemmed from the word “Yang” within the six words of the Physique Scripture. It is one of the two strongest and extreme Yang Physiques!”</p><p>Su Yonghuang coldly said: “Even though Grandpa Tu had spoken of your miracles, I know that you have some talents even considering the Patriarch teaching you in your dreams. However, regarding Physiques, don’t boast ignorantly. If you know that I am a Solar Immortal Physique, then you should know that, as his descendant, this Physique is proven.”</p><p>In fact, Su Yonghuang was very angry at the moment. Her origin could be considered very mysterious, but Li Qiye easily found out her true details. In turn, she didn’t know anything about Li Qiye. This made her very nervous.</p><p>Su Yonghuang’s words made Li Qiye laugh out loud. Regarding the different types of Physiques and Physique methods, throughout all of the nine worlds and ten earths, if he claimed to be second, no one would dare to claim to be first! He spent countless years with the Physique Scripture, and the number of Immortal Physiques that came out from him was more than just Immortal Emperor Min Ren’s Solar Immortal Physique!</p><p>Seeing Li Qiye’s laughing, Su Yonghuang retorted with a deep tone: “What are you laughing at!”</p><p>Li Qiye shook his head: “Even though you don’t believe it, my words are the truth. The Solar Immortal Physique Merit Law might be the ultimate technique of your Su Clan, but you truly practiced the wrong Physique.”</p><p>The six words of the Physique Scripture were not allowed to be circulated because of him. Immortal Emperor Min Ren learned the Solar Immortal Physique from him, and the Black Dragon King also learned an Immortal Physique method as well. However, they had a pact with Li Qiye and used their True Fate to make the oath.</p><p>There was only one exception, and that was Su Ru. Because Su Ru gave birth to the son of Min Ren, this meant that in the future, this branch would have a high chance of the Solar Immortal Physique appearing. No matter whether it was the Sky Physique within the Saint Physiques, or Minor Sky Physique and Mutual Sky Physique within the King Physiques.</p><p>Li Qiye was always ashamed when he saw Su Ru, so he broke his own rule and gave her the Solar Immortal Physique. It was not for Min Ren, but for her own achievements and contributions.</p><p>“You said that I practiced the wrong Physique, then come up with some solid evidence.”</p><p>Staring at Li Qiye and noticing that he was not joking, she gravely said. Li Qiye looked at Su Yonghuang and finally said: “An ancestral grandmother from your family in a random generation must have been the Heavenly Devil Physique at grand completion, one of the twelve Saint Physiques, correct?”</p><p>Hearing these words, Su Yonghuang’s expression slightly moved. She stared at Li Qiye in amazement and said: “How did you know?”</p><p>“I calculated using my fingers.” Li Qiye smiled: “Moreover, with regards to your Inner Physique… Whenever you channel the incantations of the Solar Immortal Physique, it became as hot as the blazing sun, right? This is a characteristic of the Solar Immortal Inner Physique. The Solar Immortal Physique is an extreme Yang method — one of the twelve Immortal Physiques. The Inner Physique becoming as hot as the blazing sun… nothing is wrong with this.”</p><p>Su Yonghuang could be considered an expert regarding this Physique. After all, their ancestor, Min Ren, was a Solar Immortal Physique. Thus, they had a very deep understanding of this Physique.</p><p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “The problem is in this matter. In the center of your Inner Physique that is as hot as the blazing sun, there is a strand of Yin energy that isn’t affected by your heat.”</p><p>Li Qiye saying so caused Su Yonghuang to be shocked because this was an extremely private matter; outsiders had no way of knowing about it. However, Li Qiye just revealed the secret of her Inner Physique which she thought was a normal aspect of the Solar Immortal Physique method.</p><p>At this moment, Su Yonghuang was a little moved as she asked: “If I practiced the wrong Physique method, then where is the mistake?’</p><p>Li Qiye continued: “From within the Yin, the Yang was born. The woman with the grand completion Heavenly Devil Physique was pregnant with the descendant carrying the Solar Immortal Physique. This was a bit outside of my expectations. If my guess is not wrong, then you thought you were a natural Minor Sky Physique, one of the twenty-four King Physiques, correct?”</p><p>Su Yonghuang emotionally replied: “Is this not correct?”</p><p>Li Qiye shook his head and said: “Wrong! You are a natural born Complete Yang Saint Physique! It is because your Physique seemed to be very similar to the Minor Sky Physique — one of the twenty-four King Physiques. In reality, your Physique is similar to the Minor Sky Physique but also the Minor Yang Physique, another King Physique! Your first impression was that because you are the descendant of Immortal Emperor Min Ren, you assumed that you were a natural born Minor Sky Physique.”</p><p>“The Complete Yang Saint Physique…” Su Yonghuang was in a daze, and she said: “One of the legendary six special Saint Physiques… the Complete Yang Saint Physique?”</p><p>There were forty-eight types of Xiantian Physiques and every two branched into a King Physique. King Physiques have twenty-four different ones and every two branched into a Saint Physique. As for Saint Physiques, cultivators in this world considered that there were twelve Saint Physiques that corresponded with the twelve Immortal Physiques.</p><p>However, true Saint Physiques altogether totaled to eighteen types. Whenever a Saint Physique was brought up, cultivators usually ignored the other six Saint Physiques.</p><p>Natural born Saint Physiques were an extremely rare occurrence. The six special Saint Physiques were even rarer and was less seen than True Dragons and Godly Kings! This was because the twelve corresponding Saint Physiques could be cultivated from the corresponding King Physiques, but the six special Saint Physiques didn’t have any other King Physiques preceding them. In another sense, the six special Saint Physiques were impure.</p><p>Li Qiye nodded his head and said: “It seems that your understanding of Physiques isn’t too bad, ah. Correct, you are a natural born Complete Yang Saint Physique, one of the eighteen Saint Physiques, and not the Minor Sky Physique like in your imagination.”</p><p>Su Yonghuang’s expression was vagarious at this moment. Even though she was normally elegant and calm, she couldn’t help it at this moment. This news to her was good news because a natural born Saint Physique was much stronger than a natural born King Physique. However, this was also a bad thing.</p><p>If she was a natural born Minor Sky Physique, then she would be one of the two King Physiques within the Solar Immortal Physique’s family. She had an advantage that others didn’t because the Su Clan had the Solar Immortal Physique method. Plus, it was the strongest, highest, and earliest method within all of the Immortal Physique methods.</p><p>With such a method, she hoped that she could one day achieve the Solar Immortal Physique just like their ancestor! This was a grand wish of the Heaven’s Edge Su Clan.</p><p>Currently, she was a natural born Complete Yang Saint Physique. This meant that she will never have the chance to cultivate a completed Solar Immortal Physique.</p><p>“The Complete Yang Saint Physique at grand completion is my limit?”</p><p>Li Qiye shook his head and said: “Not necessarily. The Complete Yang Saint Physique still cannot escape the word 'Yang'. The Physique was simply given birth by the fusion between the Solar Immortal Physique and the Heavenly Devil Physique. The Complete Yang Saint Physique is nine parts Yang and one part Yin, and Yang was born from Yin. As long as the Immortal Physique method is strong enough, the Complete Yang Saint Physique could still become the Extreme Light Immortal Physique!”</p><p>The Extreme Light Immortal Physique was one of the two extreme Yang Immortal Physiques, along with the Solar Immortal Physique.</p><p>Su Yonghuang couldn’t help but ask: “What type of Immortal Physique method would allow for it to become the Extreme Light Immortal Physique?”</p><p>“The strongest, the highest, and the earliest Immortal Physique method.”</p><p>Hearing this, Su Yonghuang’s heart was shaking. The strongest, highest, and earliest Immortal Physique method could only come from the Physique Scripture, but there was no one in this world who knew where it was! How their Su Clan and Immortal Emperor Min Ren obtained the Solar Immortal Physique was not written down! However, they do know that their Physique method was the strongest, highest, and earliest method from the Physique Scripture. This was a highly guarded secret; outside of the direct descendant, no one else knew that their method came from the scripture.</p><p>In reality, the Dark Crow, Li Qiye, passed down the God of War Formula along with the Solar Immortal Physique to Su Ru, but Su Ru made a vow to never reveal the Dark Crow or the Physique Scripture to her descendants.</p><p>After a long time, Su Yonghuang looked at Li Qiye and said: “I do not know your history nor origin, but after today, I trust in your abilities. If you drive the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, I trust that there will finally be a day of revitalization, and the will of my ancestors will not be destroyed. The sect master’s seat will be passed onto you since you are the most suitable candidate.”</p><p>“Passing the seat to me?” Li Qiye was a bit surprised.</p><p>Su Yonghuang smiled, and she elegantly said while looking at Li Qiye: “The elders do not willing serve me when I am the sect master — I know this in my heart. If this sect was not founded by my own ancestor, I wouldn’t be willing to be involved in this muddy water. Revitalizing the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect — such an easy thing to say. Letting a little thirteen-year-old girl at that time to become the new sect master… This was an impossible matter. If Elder Xu didn’t think that I could successfully cultivate the Solar Immortal Physique and let me become the sect master, I wouldn’t have stayed behind.”</p><p>Su Yonghuang’s words were very candid and direct. Finished speaking, she paused for a moment and stared at Li Qiye, then she continued: “Today, there is a successor to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Plus, I do need to go back to the Heaven’s Edge Su Clan.”</p><p>“You and your ancestral grandmother…” Li Qiye almost blurted something out, but then he shut his mouth.</p>
