<p>The only possible explanation – Li Qiye cultivated a peerless and incomparable Physique! The weight of this kick left a matchless and profound impression when she thought of Li Qiye.</p><p>Li Shuangyan’s mind shook. She couldn’t recover for a long time as she was thinking about many things.</p><p>On the second day, Li Qiye once again appeared at the martial hall, sitting high above. In the practice field, the three hundred disciples were gathered, and at this moment, the entire martial hall was completely silent.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, one did not know how many disciples were frightened by Li Qiye; yesterday, all of them were thrown to the ground by Li Qiye, and they received a good beating. This kind of pain; when they thought of it, they couldn’t help but shiver their whole body. <a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></p><p>However, the Serpent Punishing Stick was amazing; even if they were hit to the point of their skin bruising and flesh breaking, there would be no damage to the bones and muscles. Not to mention, yesterday, Li Qiye pulled his punches on many students; with a touch of golden healing paste, there would be no hindrance the next day.</p><p>Yesterday, many were scared by Li Qiye; thus, today, when Li Qiye’s gaze swept the field, many of the disciple’s hearts were beating drums; they didn’t dare to look at him in the eyes.</p><p>“Very good; there are brothers and sisters with courage that can complain about me.” Li Qiye smiled, and he said: “However, I don’t know if these brothers and sisters who complained about me have the courage to stand up or not?”</p><p>At this point, many disciples looked at each other in dismay; seeing Li Qiye’s beaming smile, their hearts were all nervous.</p><p>“One person commits the crime will be one person accepts the punishment; it was I who complained about you.” Luo Fenghua stood up, and he loudly said. Even though Luo Fenghua could walk right now and his body had no serious wounds, his face was covered with medicinal pastes, undermining his angry handsome face.</p><p>Li Qiye stepped down from his high position, and he beamingly smiled at Luo Fenghua. Nodding his head, he said: “People that have courage, I have always admired; younger brother Luo is someone I can admire without a doubt. However, you dared to challenge my authority, so you will be enlightened about the consequence of challenging my authority. Today, young brother Luo wants to crawl back, or be carried back by other people?”</p><p>When he finished speaking, he slowly took out his Serpent Punishing stick.</p><p>Seeing Li Qiye’s smile, with the Serpent Punishing stick in his hand, all of the disciples – regardless of whether they were male or females – couldn’t help but greatly sour their expressions.</p><p>“Using… Using treasure… What kind of skill?” Luo Fenghua turned pale, but he was still standing up straight. He loudly said: “If you are skillful, you should have a real match with me! With real techniques!”</p><p>By now, even a fool could see that the ordinary wooden stick in Li Qiye’s hand was a treasure.</p><p>“You truly want to have a match with me?” Li Qiye stared at Luo Fenghua in front of him, and he smiled.</p><p>Currently, the thing Luo Fenghua was unwilling to see the most was Li Qiye’s beaming smile. Looking at Li Qiye’s demeanor, his heart became uncertain; however, he gritted his teeth, and he became determined. He loudly said: “Thats right, if you are skillful, use real techniques to have a discussion with me. If you are stronger than me, I will have no other words to say.”</p><p>“Since younger brother Luo wants to discuss things a little bit, then, I will have to have a discussion with you.” Li Qiye smilingly withdrew his Serpent Punishing stick, then, he stared at Luo Fenghua and said: “I am the older brother, it wouldn’t be fitting for me to make the first move. You go first.”</p><p>Luo Fenghua saw that Li Qiye had withdrew the Serpent Punishing stick; in his mind, he was ecstatic. He took out his sword, and he loudly said: “Good, we shall discuss a little bit.”</p><p>The words had just ended, Luo Fenghua crossed his sword horizontally, and he immediately put on a careful guard – his first move was a defensive form.</p><p>Luo Fenghua was frightened by Li Qiye, so he was already on the defensive.</p><p>“A bit talented.” Li Qiye examined his careful defensive form, and he smiled. In the blink of an eye, his Life Wheel appeared, blood energy rotated, and he sent one kick went out.</p><p>A “Pop” sound was heard; under one kick, Luo Fenghua’s defensive formation was not of use. His whole body flew three meters, his sword was broken at once, and he laid on the floor, spraying a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Crack, crack”; before Luo Fenghua had fallen on the ground, the sound of a bone breaking was heard – a bone in his chest was broken. He lied on the ground, spewing out blood, and his eyes went blank as he fainted.</p><p>Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique! Li Qiye’s cultivation was the unbeatable and strongest Physique in the world! One kick, the weight of ten thousand mountains; one could only imagine how heavy this kick was.</p><p>All of the disciples were shocked; within the three hundred disciples, Luo Fenghua’s cultivation wasn’t the highest; however, it could be counted with one’s finger. He couldn’t even block one kick from Li Qiye. How could this be possible?</p><p>Li Qiye slowly put his foot back down and said: “That was one kick with one-tenth of my weight behind it, yet you still couldn’t block it; still, you had the arrogance to challenge me.”</p><p>This one kick, Li Qiye had shown mercy; otherwise, this one kick with its true power, Luo Fenghua would definitely be dead.</p><p>On the side, Nan Huairen slightly shook his head. Half a year ago, his oldest brother had not yet cultivated; even Du Yuanguang and Xu Hui were dismembered by him at that time. Currently, he had cultivated; Luo Fenghua, here, was courting his death.</p><p>Without Li Qiye’s command, Nan Huairen woke up Luo Fenghua, helped him reconnect his broken bone, put on some silver medicinal paste, and he then carried him back to his place.</p><p>“It seems like I still should use the Serpent Punishing stick to discipline you guys well, ah; it’s basically not as dangerous.” Li Qiye once again took out the Serpent Punishing stick, and he randomly pointed at another disciple; he said: “You, come out; if you have any skills, use all of them here.”</p><p>“Old-older brother, I-I-I didn’t complain about you, I, I swear to the heaven, I absolutely didn’t complain.”</p><p>Li Qiye nodded seriously, and he said: “I know you didn’t complain, but, the content of the second lesson is still my beating you guys, again. Of course, you all could try to run; however, if you get caught by me, I will beat you ten times harder than I did yesterday. It is best that you guys believe my words, otherwise, the consequences will be serious.”</p><p>The disciple had no other choice; he hesitantly stepped up, and he said while trembling: “Older brother, please show mercy.”</p><p>“Wanting me to show you mercy is not as good as putting in your own effort! One blow at full power, the initiative is in your hands.” Li Qiye smiled with his eyes closed. Finished speaking, a strike immediately came.</p><p>Without any other choice, the disciple had to fight.</p><p>“Bang… Bang… Bang…” This disciple couldn’t handle more than two techniques against Li Qiye’s hands. Immediately taken to the ground by the Serpent Punishing stick, Li Qiye was free to beat him up until he was in unbearable pain, but at least it was better compared to yesterday, there was no visible blood.</p><p>“You, you, you…” Li Qiye pointed a few times, and he said: “All of you come.”</p><p>“Bang… Bang… Bang…” Many techniques came out; the three hundred disciples were, once again, beaten to the ground by Li Qiye. Many painful howls rang; whether real or fake, at least, this type of pain was straight to the bone marrow. At least, today, Li Qiye didn’t mercilessly beat them up; there was no blood, but, this type of pain was still torturous.</p><p>“Little kids cannot be caught!” Li Qiye shook his head and lamented quietly, then he turned around and left.</p><p>The third day, Li Qiye appeared one more time. The three hundred disciples were summoned to the field. What was outside of Li Qiye’s expectations was that Luo Fenghua, who had a broken chest bone from yesterday, also came.</p><p>After being beaten twice, currently, to all three hundred disciples, meeting Li Qiye was like meeting a ghost; their hearts trembled, and the taste of the Serpent Punishing stick would be a nightmare for a long time to them.</p><p>This was understandable for them. That year, when Immortal Emperor Min Ren was still young, the undefeated generals, who had followed Immortal Emperor Min Ren to fight in the nine heavens and ten earths, they, at a young age, also didn’t forget the taste of the Serpent Punishing stick for a long time! Even after receiving the Heaven’s Will and becoming an Immortal Emperor, when he thought back about this period, he was also filled with all kinds of emotions.</p><p>“The third class’ content is still to beat you!”</p><p>Li Qiye stepped down, once again, and he beamingly smiled.</p><p>When Li Qiye’s words came out, the disciples couldn’t help but shiver. They had already been beaten twice; this frightened them to the point of their legs giving up.</p><p>“Who is first?” Li Qiye smiled, and he gazed at the three hundred disciples here. As his eyes swept around, many students were shivering; they couldn’t help but take a step back.</p><p>“Me.” In the end, the first to step up was Luo Fenghua, again. Luo Fenghua stood up, and he loudly said: “I will come!”</p><p>Finished speaking, he took out a large shield.</p><p>Luo Fenghua, on the other hand, was smart. Today, he especially brought a large shield hoping that it could deflect the Serpent Punishing stick in the hand of Li Qiye.</p><p>“You have some courage, and you are even a little clever.” Li Qiye nodded his head, and he smiled.</p><p>“Bang… Bang… Bang…” In the end, Luo Fenghua couldn’t escape his fate of being beaten. If the Serpent Punishing stick could be stopped by a large shield, then it would not be worthy of being taken out of the Demon Forest by Li Qiye.</p><p>At this moment, Li Qiye had beaten Luo Fenghua badly, and he stained him with fresh blood – he was beaten until he couldn’t stand up from the ground, groaning in pain.</p><p>Witnessing Li Qiye’s merciless action, the rest of the disciple’s expressions greatly changed; however, they didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>“Clever indeed, but, you used it in the wrong place. One point of intelligence becomes wisdom. Next, you will want to use your brain even more. This meal, I fiercely beat you, so that you will use more of your brain.” Li Qiye comfortably said.</p><p>This day, all of the disciples were beaten by Li Qiye again. This time, Li Qiye was much more merciless than yesterday; many disciples saw blood, lying on the floor, and they were not being able to stand up.</p><p>On the fourth day, Li Qiye casually said: “The fourth day, it is still as before: beating you. Who will be the first one?"</p><p>This time, all of the disciple’s faces quickly changed. They quickly stepped back, one after another; no one wanted to be the first to come out. Even Luo Fenghua, who was courageous yesterday, didn’t dare to come out.</p><p>“I-I, I will go.” In the end, an eighteen-year-old teenager stood up; this young boy appeared to be honest, but his body was still very strong.</p><p>“What is your name?” Li Qiye glanced at this young boy, he had an impression of him. Each time he had beaten them, all of the other disciples wanted to escape and flee; however, this disciple was tenacious. Every time, he tried to face the beatings head on. Each time he fell to the ground, he desperately tried to stand up; his mentality wasn’t bad. This left Li Qiye with a not-so-shallow impression.</p><p>This disciple scratched his head, and he politely said: “Respectful older brother, my name is Zhang Yu.”</p><p>“Why be the first one to come out?” Li Qiye smiled, and he asked.</p><p>“Wh-when older brother is happy, you beat us anyway; when you are unhappy, you will still beat us. Older brother just wants to beat us; since we can’t run, wh-why not be the first?” Zhang Yu stuttered while speaking.</p><p><span id="footnote_1" class="footnote">[1] The first sentence is an expression, using ‘not known’ as a way to say a great number/many.</span></p>
