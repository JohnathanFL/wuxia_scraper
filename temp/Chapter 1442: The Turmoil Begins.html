In a short period of time, conflicting opinions appeared everywhere.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that this island was mobile and could appear anywhere in the Heaven Spirit World. However, it still rarely showed itself to the world. Because of this, few had seen it in person.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, it was completely untraceable so no one would know where it was. Because of this, this power was full of mysteries.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, its sudden appearance at Godhalt made many people curious. The older crowd was even more shocked because they knew it wouldn’t appear so easily. Its emergence in full view of everyone meant that a grand event was about to happen.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The appearance of this island made many people think about the recent gossip. An ancestor-level character wondered: “Could it be that Godhalt really has an immortal medicine of immortality?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the second day, an even more shocking piece of news came.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The True Martial Goddess is personally coming to Godhalt!” This resounding news exploded across Godhalt. Many arrogant characters were shaken.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some youths had never heard of this character, so they curiously asked their astounded elders: “Who the heck is the True Martial Goddess?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a pale expression, a shaken elder slowly answered: “The daughter of the True Martial Sea God. She’s a genius who was once the most likely candidate to become the next sea god.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This news left many people breathless. Those who knew about this name was aware of just how significant it was.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people in the world let their imaginations run wild as she personally entered Godhalt.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the favorite daughter of True Martial. Rumor has it that at a young age, she had already displayed exemplary talents that even exceeded her own father when he was younger.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her cultivation was also exceedingly high, so she was famous across the nine worlds. Many people held her in high esteem and thought that she would have the best chance of becoming the next sea god.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, there were rumors that claim that it was a certainty because back in that era, she had used her father’s Trident and was accepted by it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Trident wouldn’t accept someone just because they were the current sea god’s daughter. Gaining its recognition meant that they had the potential to become a sea god.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that era, with her father and his legion’s protection on top of being accepted by the Trident, it seemed that her becoming a sea god was almost a fact.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, for some unknown reasons, the True Martial Goddess suddenly disappeared from sight. No one had seen her again, so people stopped talking about her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People gradually forgot about the goddess. No one knew why she suddenly disappeared instead of becoming the next sea god.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, the missing goddess had returned in order to visit Godhalt.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could people not be shocked when such an existence was arriving? The sea demons were especially ecstatic and applauded this new development.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her return held great significance for their race as a whole!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that she wants to become the next sea god this time? This means she’ll be competing against the Seven Sea Goddess and Seashield Prince.” Some sea demons were happy while others sad.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the midst of all the discussions, someone had arrived at Godhalt on this particular day. This woman with a matchless demeanor descended from above like an immortal from the nine heavens. Anyone would be swooned after being in her peerless presence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lunargrasp Fairy!” A God-monarch saw her supreme figure at Godhalt and was immediately captivated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The news of her arrival spread across Godhalt in just one day, sending the entire continent into a furor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lunargrasp Fairy!” Some heard of her personal arrival and took a deep breath while others started shuddering.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Meng Zhentian’s biggest threat is here.” A God-Monarch slowly commented: “In this generation, his biggest threat isn’t Li Qiye, it is the Lunargrasp Fairy! He must surpass an invincible existence like her or else he will never become emperor!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian’s reputation was illustrious and was brothers with Immortal Emperor Ta Kong.

Before Empress Hong Tian ascended, the fairy was already a supreme character in the nine worlds.

However, Lunargrasp was still able to become one of the strongest rivals of Hongtian. This was indicative of her strength.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is going on in this generation?” Some prodigies were shaken after hearing this news: “First, there’s Meng Zhentian, and then the Prince of Darkness and True Martial Goddess. Now, even the Lunargrasp Fairy is out? Do all the Era Evaders want to come out?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many geniuses felt dejected with the fairy’s appearance at Godhalt.

Some wanted to become emperor while others wanted to become the next sea god. However, the appearance of these great characters immediately disappointed these hot-blooded geniuses and drove them crazy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They simply had no chance against these apex existences.

Sima Yujian, who was guarding the peak, heaved a sigh of relief after seeing their safe return.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His trip was now over so they left the Undying Gate.

The gate master had both ability and ambition. Alas, he was born at Godhalt. Without enough luck and help from others, it was easier said than done to weather the storm and revive the sect. Nobody can do anything without the necessary means.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll stop here then.” The gate master said: “Godhalt will shine with your presence.

Rumor has it that an immortal medicine has come out in Godhalt. Recently, the Spirit Abyss began to move as well and ordered many disciples to find it. Even the Prince of Darkness has come out, so maybe this type of medicine does exist. Perhaps you could try looking for it too…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after his message was received, he looked up and saw that Li Qiye’s group was long gone.
