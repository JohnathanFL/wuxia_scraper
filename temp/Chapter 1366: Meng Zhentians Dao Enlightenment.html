The huge image behind him fused with his body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this fusion, his blood energy underwent an incredible metamorphosis. His divinity erupted, turning him into a real Celestial God. His supreme prestige seemed to have been granted by the heavens itself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The hymn of the sword rang again. His sword turned as red as blood, as if all of his energy had been poured inside. It turned into a bloodsword capable of splitting the heaven and earth.&nbsp;<a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sword seemed to suddenly come alive due to its vibrant vitality. It was as if the young man had granted it this chance. With a hymn, the bent sword became straight again; it was now capable of shouldering the sky to stop the miniature tower.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the spectators now saw two gods since his sword emitted a frightening divinity as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Outside of being born in the wrong generation with Meng Zhentian, who else could contend against him?” Many people were astonished to see his current form.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom! Boom!” His sword continued to withstand the smaller tower while he walked closer to the real one. As he came close, the suppression of the small tower grew increasingly stronger.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though his sword — full of divinity — was no longer bending from the pressure, his body was withstanding an unspeakable suppression. Despite his soaring blood energy, he was the one bending down instead. He was like a true dragon in the sky and tried his best to stand upright.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, even if he was stronger, he still wouldn’t be able to sustain this situation. His body bent down again. He was only inches away yet it was impossible to reach. Eventually, he let out one more roar. The divinity of the sword radiated a dazzling light as he unleashed a heaven-defying slash at the miniature tower.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” He used this attack to break the pressure from the tower and quickly retreated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.” After he left the altar, the miniature tower disappeared. A light emerged again and gave birth to the same weapons that started to float around the altar.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Swiftdao God quietly stood in front of this tower. The altar was protected by a powerful ancient force. As for the tower, it seemed to be guarded by the gods themselves. Anyone who approached would be suppressed with no way of entering. The spectators neither commented on nor mocked his failure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a God-Monarch had been slaughtered in seconds, so him coming out unscathed has already proved his might. Even a Godking might not fare better than him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His failure made many people feel hopeless. They knew that there was a matchless treasure inside the tower, and even if there was no treasure, this was probably a great place to learn the dao. However, what was the point of this great location if no one could enter? There was no one else for them to rely on. Even a Godking might not be much stronger than the Swiftdao God.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Suddenly, the entire continent quaked. A loud explosion accompanied by an immortal beam rushed to the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone exclaimed after seeing this: “That’s coming from the other location with the magical light.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This blast came from the place exclusively occupied by Meng Zhentian. At this moment, the ridge was erupting with immortal light. A door had been opened, seemingly connecting to an immortal world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Screech!” A phoenix cry suddenly came with a phoenix flying out of the door.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aoooo!” Next was a dragon roar along with a true dragon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawrr!” Then, a white tiger howled and jumped out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, the four divine beasts appeared from the door. A true dragon, phoenix, white tiger, and black tortoise surrounded the four corners of this mountain. The mountain itself unexpectedly exuded a radiance full of divinity that wouldn’t disperse. It became quite a sacred location.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are these the mythical beasts in the legends?” The spectators were shaken by this scene.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four beasts emitted auras that left them breathless. Even a Godking was quivering because this force was truly fearful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re not the real deal, they’re only projections.” A paragon slowly explained to the crowd after seeing through them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This didn’t make the crowd any less frightened. Just their projections were this terrifying? What if the real creatures were before them? Wouldn’t all of them immediately die from the pressure?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Wondrous sounds came from inside the door with a very particular rhythm. Outsiders could only hear these noises and nothing else.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed that this was the sound of an immortal preaching a scripture, as if there were immortals on the other side.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this rhythm, a genius understood right away and exclaimed: “It’s Meng Zhentian! He’s trying to ponder the dao!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A scared commenter murmured: “Will it be the dao of an Immortal Emperor?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone from the older generation shook his head and clarified: “No, Meng Zhentian’s self-created dao could have accepted the Heaven’s Will long ago since it accepted him in the last generation. He is perfecting his own grand dao before taking the last step to becoming a real emperor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” The moment these words fell, another burst of explosions came about. Violent lightning appeared in the clear sky. Each ray was as thick as a great serpent; they tore the sky vault apart and danced like wild snakes. The entire region was suppressed by the heavens. Heaven Spirit as a whole was affected.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” Suddenly, a blaring blast resounded. A huge palm shattered the sky along with all the massive lightning rays. This palm seemed to be engulfing the entire world. Billions and billions of existences were left to its whim.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All were nothing before its grandeur.

The power of the nine heavens and ten earths seemed to be converging at this mountain. It gave the feeling that the master of the universe and myriad realms was presiding over this place.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inhabitants of Heaven Spirit were aghast. The masses felt the impulse to prostrate and worship this power. It seemed to be representing the supreme will of the high heavens, as if a new emperor was being born.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This force awakened everyone, including the unparalleled existences that had been slumbering. Many ancient monsters opened their eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the old monsters slowly commented: “It looks like Meng Zhentian is getting closer and closer to the throne.
