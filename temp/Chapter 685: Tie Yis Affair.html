<p><b>Chapter 685: Tie Yi’s Affair</b></p><p>“Ah…” The figure crawling up from the ground hurriedly replied: “If Young Noble desires, I would answer your call anywhere and anytime, so of course we are on the same side.”</p><p>This figure was Old Demon Tie Yi from the Celestial Peak Mountain. At this time, he was cheerfully smiling while scratching his head with his ant claw. However, while he was laughing, he was occasionally taking glances at the Imperial Draco-Bull relaxing to the side.</p><p>“Really? You will answer my call?” Li Qiye looked at him with one eye and said: “You are not here to steal my bull?”</p><p>“Moo!” The bull also lifted its head and let out a cry at Tie Yi. This gesture did scare him quite a bit.</p><p>“No, no, no. Young Noble, this is a misunderstanding.” Tie Yi hastily waved his hands and explained: “Even if I was a thousand times more courageous, no, ten thousand times more courageous, I wouldn’t dare to even have such a thought. Moreover, your divine bull is unparalleled and unique in all of eternity. Outside of Young Noble, no one else deserves such a divine bull…”</p><p>Tie Yi didn’t only suck up to Li Qiye, he even buttered up the bull as well. His flattery left the bull satisfied and refreshed, so it laid back down in a comfortable posture.</p><p>Li Qiye was too lazy to glance at Tie Yi and respond to his incessant flattery, so he said: “I have seen many sycophants, but not many of them were at the same level as you. To be able to make a bull this happy, this is a whole new level of art.”</p><p>The old demon only cheerfully laughed after hearing Li Qiye and wasn’t embarrassed in the slightest.</p><p>Li Qiye looked at the demon and asked: “You didn’t stay at the Celestial Peak Mountain? Why are you here at the Allpine Mountain?”</p><p>“I am here to... “ Tie Yi opened his mouth to say something but was quickly interrupted by Li Qiye with a wave of his sleeve. Li Qiye shook his head and said: “If you are about to say that you are here to work for me, then forget it. If you lie so much, you better watch it or else I’ll squeeze your true form out before crushing it.”</p><p>“Ah…” Tie Yi hurriedly responded: “Young Noble is so funny, too funny. I only came here to see the world as well as the grand celebration of the treefather where everyone comes together. This is quite a rare occasion, so I must broaden my horizons. Of course, if Young Noble ever needs my assistance, then I’ll be more than happy to help.”</p><p>Li Qiye glanced at him and slowly asked: “You want to see the world by sneaking underground?”</p><p>“Well…” Tie Yi forced out a chuckle and replied: “About that… This little demon is only an insignificant character, so I’m afraid they won’t let me in at the front door. Moreover, the Allpine Treefather is merciful and benevolent, so he won’t mind a little guy like me.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Li Qiye stroked his chin for a bit while looking at Tie Yi, causing Tie Yi to be frightened out of his mind. His intuition told him that something bad was going to happen.</p><p>“If Young Noble has nothing else, then this little, little demon will excuse myself as I don’t want to bother your quiet time.” The jumpy old demon quickly told Li Qiye.</p><p>“No rush, no rush, since you took a lot of time to come here, how about we have a nice chat?” Li Qiye leisurely suggested.</p><p>When he heard Li Qiye talk about “a nice chat”, the old demon knew that something bad was going to happen for sure. His mind was jumping from fear as he quickly replied: “Young Noble, this little demon doesn’t know anything, so I won’t be able to hold a conversation with you…” He spoke as he retreated backward.</p><p>“I won’t stop you if you want to leave, but I might accidentally spill news about someone wanting to dig out the main root. That wouldn’t be good, would it?” Li Qiye leisurely spoke again.</p><p>“No, no, no…” Tie Yi was horrified by these words and he hurriedly responded: “Ahh… Young Noble, you are definitely misunderstanding something. I am happy to contribute to your cause any time and anywhere. Just say the words and I’ll even head into a sea of fire without hesitation.”</p><p>“Into a sea of fire?” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed as he burst out in laughter and said: “This fellow daoist, your words are too much. There is no need for you to run into a sea of fire, how could I ask such a thing from you?”</p><p>Tie Yi was stricken with fear after seeing Li Qiye’s expression. He made a decision and said: “Young Noble, please spare me. Just tell me what you want me to do directly.”</p><p>“So refreshingly straightforward.” Li Qiye clapped his hands and said: “I am a person without a lot of merits, but I do appreciate straightforward people like you. It is quite a rare sight these days, ah.”</p><p>At this time, Tie Yi had resigned to his fate as he drooped his head while saying: “What does Young Noble want me to do?”</p><p>“You said that iron ants like you love to dig holes? Correct. To be more exact, iron ants are best at digging and hiding underground.” Li Qiye leisurely said.</p><p>“What does Young Noble want me to dig out?” Tie Yi couldn’t help but shudder. Very quickly, he thought about something and frighteningly exclaimed with a shocked expression: “Young Noble, you won’t make me go dig at that location, right?!”</p><p>“What location?” Li Qiye played the fool and asked: “Is there a particularly valuable location in this place?”</p><p>Tie Yi immediately shut his mouth and knew that he was very unlucky this time. If he knew this was going to happen, he wouldn’t have messed with Li Qiye. This was the same as him digging a grave for himself and jumping down to finish the job.</p><p>At this time, Li Qiye looked at him with squinted eyes before revealing a lazy smirk as he said: “Fellow Daoist Tie Yi, how about this, go to that location underground.”</p><p>“No, absolutely not.” At this time, Tie Yi shook his head at a rapid pace and hurriedly answered: “Young Noble, please don’t misunderstand, I don’t know of any locations underground.”</p><p>Li Qiye sat back in his armchair and gently waved his sleeve towards Tie Yi, saying: “Okay, don’t pretend anymore, everyone here knows what is going on. You can put on your pitiful and weak act in front of others, and they might believe you, but I am very aware of what you can do. If it wasn’t out of consideration for your non-malicious intentions, I would have already forced your true body out back at the Celestial Peak Mountain.”</p><p>Tie Yi wryly smiled but didn’t say anything else at this time.</p><p>“I was going to take a look at that location underground.” Li Qiye semi-laid down and slowly spoke: “However, with you here, nothing could be better; I won’t have to waste too much effort. Moreover, you have been there before, so the trip will be very familiar to you. No one would have an easier time getting there than you.”</p><p>“Young Noble, you think too highly of me.” Tie Yi gave a mirthless smile and said: “This is the territory of the Allpine Treefather. As long as he wants to know, nothing would be able to elude him within the span of a million miles in this land.”</p><p>At this time, Li Qiye looked at him with one eye and asked: “But aren’t you still doing it?”</p><p>Tie Yi took a deep breath and replied: “Young Noble, I won’t hide it from you. A lowly character like me sneaking in… Even if the Treefather found out, he wouldn’t take the time to care about me. However, if Young Noble wants me to dig at that location, he will certainly kill me. I don’t dare to dig there since I only want to sense something underground, that’s all.”</p><p>Here, he paused for a bit before continuing: “Let’s take a step back and assume that the treefather found out, he probably won’t care since I am only doing so out of curiosity. If Young Noble knows about that location underground, then you definitely know that that place is not to be disturbed, or else the treefather will unleash his fury onto us! In the Stone Medicine World, how many people can withstand his wrath? Not to mention, we are doing it at the Allpine Mountain!”</p><p>“I know, I’m not telling you to dig all the way inside. I just want you to get close for a good look, then you can come back and report to me.” Li Qiye lightly added: “I trust your top-notch digging skills. As for your ability to escape... There is no room for critique.”</p><p>“This…” Tie Yi couldn’t help but hesitate after hearing Li Qiye.</p><p>Li Qiye glanced at him then dismissively said: “I will not say more about other matters. You came from the capital of the Giant Bamboo Country all the way to the Celestial Peak Mountain, and now you are here at the Allpine Mountain, do I need to say more?”</p><p>Tie Yi was slightly stunned by this sentence while Li Qiye continued on: “Even though you might not be following me, do you think this is only a coincidence?”</p><p>Tie Yi sighed and smiled wryly: “Do I have any other choice?”</p><p>Li Qiye laid back in his chair and leisurely said: “Yes, unless you don’t want to beg me. I am a person who could be said to not lack anything. Even if I need something, as long as I am willing, I can immediately obtain it… If you want to beg me, then you need to at least take out an item capable of tempting me. If you can’t, then that is fine too as long as you can show some sincerity and work for me and achieve great merits. As long as I am willing, many people in this world would be eager to answer my call. Do you think that I am giving you this chance, or is it something that you have to earn?” Having said this, Li Qiye glanced at the demon.</p><p>Tie Yi was stunned after hearing this. He didn’t think that Li Qiye knew everything so well since he was confident that his disguise was exceptional. However, it was still seen through by Li Qiye.</p><p>After a while, he took a deep breath and looked at Li Qiye to say: “So to speak, Young Noble can solve my problem?”</p><p>“The wounds have been there for too long, so this is indeed tricky.” Li Qiye smiled and paused for a bit before continuing: “However, that is only for other people — it is nothing to me. Of course, you and I don’t really know each other, and we also aren’t friends, so if you want me to do something, shouldn’t you show some sincerity first?”</p><p>Here, Li Qiye shrugged and said: “Of course, if you don’t want to, then I won’t force you. Going to that location underground isn’t an issue for me. Of course, if someone was willing to work for me, then I would be happy to oblige.”</p><p>“No, no problem.” At this time, Tie Yi made a decision and quickly said: “Your business is my business. This little demon is willing to work for Young Noble and solve your issues. Just say the word, this little demon is waiting for your command at any time.”</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>[spoiler title='685 Teaser']“Ah…” The figure crawling up from the ground hurriedly replied: “If Young Noble desires, I would answer your call anywhere and anytime, so of course we are on the same side.”</p><p>This figure was Old Demon Tie Yi from the Celestial Peak Mountain.
