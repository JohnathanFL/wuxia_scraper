<p><b>Chapter 1011: That Item</b></p><p>Having said that, Li Qiye paused for a moment and looked into a distant location to say: “To destroy that ultimate existence, that would really be flipping the heavens over!”</p><p>“Which is why you need that item. With that pot in your possession, there is another glimmer of hope in destroying that existence!” The little figure in the yellow cloth egged him on.</p><p>“Haha, little girl, don’t try to encourage me.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “That broken pot is a double-edged sword. It can make you eternal for countless springs or turn you into a devil for endless eras. An item like that… it is hard to say who will be able to control it in the final battle…”</p><p>“Haha, otherwise, this plateau wouldn’t exist!” Li Qiye continued on: “Although no one knows the name ‘Di Shi’ anymore, he is wise with great insight and completely peerless. Many supreme existences cannot compare to him, but in the end, he still chose to endure it. Why? Because he doesn’t have the confidence! Even with this pot in his hand, it didn’t guarantee success!”</p><p>“But you are different.” The little figure spoke: “How long have you been preparing for? You have so many items that you’ve prepared in secrecy... If you have this pot as well, then your chances of victory would be thirty percent higher!”</p><p>“No…” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head slightly: “It seems like you still don’t understand. You simply don’t know what we will have to face!”</p><p>“Bah, who says that I don’t know? I know way more than you!” The figure snorted.</p><p>“Have you personally gone on an expedition?” Li Qiye smiled wryly: “Do you know what is at the end? Do you know what invincibility is? When you personally fight in the coming war, you will find out that all existences called 'invincible' are incredibly insignificant in comparison!”</p><p>“What about you?” The figure had to ask: “Have you ever seen a true god? What about that true existence?”</p><p>Li Qiye stared at the horizon and eventually replied: “I was able to come back alive because I was immortal and indestructible! Because that existence couldn’t trace back to the location of my true body. Otherwise… once found, even if I was indestructible, there would be no escaping death!”</p><p>“I see now.” The little figure spoke: “You talked about the Immortal Demon Grotto. So it is not that you couldn't escape the grotto, you wanted to use it to hide your true body!”</p><p>“Perhaps.” Li Qiye neither denied nor confirmed this, he only smiled: “It is not that easy to attack the grotto. Even an Immortal Emperor must pay a price! A very heavy price!”</p><p>“What about this generation?” The figure asked: “What will you use to hide your body this time? Don’t forget, you are no longer invincible! Do you still have confidence in winning now? You can’t afford to lose any longer! Losing means turning to ashes!”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I will not lose in this generation, I will definitely sweep through all things!” His eyes became extremely profound with an indescribably domineering aura. Even the high heavens would quake from this. He slowly continued: “Nothing will stop my advance. Even that existence above the nine heavens won’t do. When the time is right, I will proceed!”</p><p>“Since you are determined to fight, you will need that pot even more. I don’t need to say more about its power. With that pot, you will have another powerful ace!” The figure didn’t give up on its persuasion.</p><p>“Little girl, there’s no need to try to convince me, I won’t do it.” Li Qiye shook his head and smiled.</p><p>“Well, in my opinion, you are afraid of this Buddhist Funeral Plateau. You aren’t certain of defeating it either!” The small figure coldly sneered.</p><p>“After all this time, little girl, you still don’t know me.” Li Qiye laughed: “The Buddhist Funeral Plateau is not as simple as you think it is. Plus, I don’t need to go against it anyway. The pot is not necessarily suitable for me.”</p><p>“Why?” The figure couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and looked towards the ancient temples in the distance as he leisurely spoke: “Everyone says that Buddha is merciful. However, I am waiting, waiting for the day when Buddha becomes angry and subdues all things! His rage shall cause blood to flow for three thousand miles!”</p><p>“You are certain it will come in this generation?” The figure inquired further.</p><p>“Maybe, maybe not.” Li Qiye responded: “In short, it won’t be long. That era will come, and it will be unimaginable. I’m afraid it will be even more brilliant than your own!”</p><p>“Bah, stop daydreaming. My era was supreme across the eons!” The figure snorted since she didn’t agree with the claim.</p><p>“Really now?” Li Qiye smiled: “But even that supreme era was annihilated in the end. No one remembers it now!”</p><p>This retort left the little figure silent. It no longer wanted to talk and disappeared. Li Qiye only smiled and put away the yellow cloth before continuing on.</p><p>***</p><p>The plateau also had magnificent sceneries. Looking further inside, one would see a great plain as well as snow-capped mountains in the far distance. Moreover, there were great rivers that resembled dragons occupying the distant lands…</p><p>This vast area had always been lively and prosperous despite its great size. Cultivators from many different origins traveled here.</p><p>Li Qiye sometimes continued to cross the mountains and rivers, and sometimes he would mingle with the long crowd of worshipers. Occasionally, he would meditate and immerse himself in the Buddhist affinity of this land…</p><p>“The first showdown of geniuses has begun. Quick, to the Snow Cloud Peak... “ As Li Qiye was walking alongside a stream of people, the crowd suddenly raised a furor. A message came, causing many cultivators to step aside right away.</p><p>This news traveled very quickly across millions of miles. Cultivators in this area all gathered here.</p><p>“Who against who?” Someone quietly asked.</p><p>Someone immediately answered: “Wo Longxuan against the Jewel Pillar Mortal King, definitely a battle of the genius level.”</p><p>“War Fanatic eh, no, I have to say War God now. He has been brilliant in these last battles so we definitely can’t miss it.” Even those of the previous generation became very excited when these two were brought up. They immediately went to watch the match.</p><p>In just a moment, many headed for the Snow Cloud Peak in order to watch this fight between the two geniuses. No one wanted to miss out on such an exciting match.</p><p>Li Qiye heard it as well, but he was not interested and continued on his way.</p><p>“Brother, don’t you want to watch?” A young man quickly asked him as he passed by.</p><p>The youth looked quite ordinary and had a flat cap on his head. He saw Li Qiye and stopped to warmly greet him.</p><p>“Oh? Will it be nice to watch?” Li Qiye looked at the youth and revealed a very deep smile.</p><p>“Definitely nice to watch. It is a duel of geniuses, Wo Longxuan versus the Jewel Pillar Mortal King!” The youth answered and introduced himself: “My name is Xiao Tianxing, what about yours?”</p><p>Li Qiye looked at him and smiled: “Chu Yuntian.”</p><p>The youth hastily responded: “So it is brother Chu, nice to meet you. Brother, come and watch. This great battle is absolutely worth watching.”</p><p>With a beaming smile, Li Qiye nodded his head: “If Brother Tianxing says so, then it has to be worth it.”</p><p>In this way, the two of them went together towards the Snow Cloud Peak. On the way, Li Qiye leisurely asked the youth that wore the flat cap: “Who is Wo Longxuan?”</p><p>“She is an amazing genius and a peerless beauty.” The youth replied: “She came from the Sleeping Dragon Cliff. Some even say that she is on par with the Heaven Protector Goddess!”</p><p>“On par with the Heaven Protector Goddess?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile. Zi Cuining, or the Heaven Protector Goddess, was the descendant of the Heaven Protector Palace. Someone comparable to her would definitely be amazing.</p><p>“Wo Longxuan became famous in recent years. Maybe you haven’t heard of her, but you have definitely heard of her big brother. He is Wo Longzi, the previous generation descendant of the cliff. He had trained at the Sacred Era Hall in the academy and was considered the most talented youth.” The guy explained.</p><p>“Wo Longzi?” Li Qiye pondered for a moment. He might have heard this name before back at the academy.</p><p>“What a shame, Wu Longzi was very amazing back then. I heard that after he left the academy to go back to the Northern Grand Sea, he wanted to reach the Virtuous Paragon realm. It is a pity that he couldn’t handle the Life Reduction. Just like that, a young genius of the generation fell.” The youth with the hat shook his head in pity.</p><p>Li Qiye only smiled. For millions of years now, countless brilliant geniuses had died to the Life Reduction tribulation.</p><p>Li Qiye casually asked: “What about the Jewel Pillar Mortal King?”</p><p>“He is the current master of the Jewel Pillar Sacred School as well as the king of the Jade Valley Country. In the past, everyone called him Jewel Pillar Saint Child.” The youth elaborated: “He is not bad at all. After taking control, both the school and the country have made great progress. Many sects pledged loyalty to him, so they gave him the title of Mortal King.”</p><p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but grin after hearing this. So it turned out to be an old friend!</p><p>The youth went on to say: “The Mortal King is extraordinary right now. He is not only praised by other as the War God but is also regarded as one of the four great Immortal Physique users!”</p><p>Li Qiye stared at him and asked: “Four great Immortal Physique users?”</p><p>To which the youth responded: “To be exact, they call them the four great Immortal Physique users of the Grand Middle Territory. Cleansing Incense has three while the Mortal King is the only user outside of this sect that has another! I heard that his Hell Suppressing Godly Physique is unbeatable.” The youth stared at Li Qiye at this point.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
