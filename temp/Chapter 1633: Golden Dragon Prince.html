Aotian was too influential at this moment. Who would dare to mock him and the Golden Dragon Prince?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People quickly turned back and saw that it came from no one but Fiercest standing in the distant with a relaxed pose.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s Fiercest.” The spectators were astonished to see Fiercest hovering in the sky while calmly watching everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They found that his boisterous laughter was completely understandable. In their eyes, he was the only qualified challenger and the only real threat for Aotian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Prince looked over as well and turned cold. He had heard of the guy’s notoriety and knew that he wasn’t easy to mess with.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince scowled to show his dissatisfaction but he didn’t dare to retort either. He was an amazing genius but going against Fiercest was not on his agenda.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts nearby glanced at each other after seeing this. That’s Fiercest for you. Even the extremely arrogant prince didn’t dare to provoke him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-233b"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An insect claims to be a golden dragon? A mortal wishing to be the high heaven’s child?” Li Qiye said flatly after hearing the scowl.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-233b">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye was only following along to see Aotian’s bloodline for a bit and see if it had undergone any transformation. After a careful observation, he found that there was no problem with it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he didn’t really care for the guy and saw no point in doing anything now. In his eyes, Aotian was no different from a dead man. It was only a matter of time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” The prince angrily glared at Li Qiye and couldn’t help from blurting: “Li Qiye, you are too arrogant!”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He naturally couldn’t endure this indignation from being publicly shamed in this manner thus he still replied even though it was Fiercest.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve always been arrogant like this, you found out just now?” Li Qiye said leisurely: “Just remember, make sure to calm down on your boasting. No one will be emperor but me in this generation.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn!” Some of the spectators secretly applauded.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that Aotian wanted the Heaven’s Will. Fiercest’s comment right now simply didn’t give the Golden Dragon Prince nor Aotian any face.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Li, your words are too smug.” Even Aotian who was fighting against Yuanhou and the dragon in the sky had to shout.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye replied right away: “I’m merely stating the truth.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The impressed crowd glanced at each other and thought that this was truly Fiercest’s style. He was still as domineering as ever even before Aotian. This lawless man didn’t care for anyone. Others were just dogs and cats in his eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s Fiercest for you. The time and place don’t matter to him at all.” People were utterly convinced by his style.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden Dragon Prince was a bit restless and also wanted to win back some face for Aotian. He snorted and said loudly: “Li Qiye, I know you are strong but there is still a way for you to go before competing with Imperial Prince Long for the Heaven’s Will.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye simply smiled and ignored this provocation. Being treated with such contempt instead of a verbal quip only further infuriated the prince. It was much more humiliating in this manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, do you dare to block my bow?” The golden prince became hot-headed and challenged Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, he wouldn’t take such a risk but he couldn’t endure this anger at this moment. Li Qiye ignored him and stood still as if he wasn’t part of this world and that he was the chess player while everything else were mere pawns.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lack of response made it intolerable for the prince. It was more unbearable than if the guy was putting him down. It seemed as if Li Qiye was an elephant treating the prince like an ant. Would the elephant care if the ant was screaming?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the prince felt his blood boiling. He wielded his bow and shouted: “Li Qiye, don’t tell me you don’t have the courage to take one strike?!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This longbow made of intertwining vines was as green as jade, beautiful and enchanting. It exuded a vibrant presence as if its arrow could travel through the ages.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A bow left behind by a Heavenly Demon!” An ancestor blurted out with astonishment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a destructive weapon left behind by the matriarch from the Mu Zhuo’s Demonic City.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Li Qiye slowly turned to look at the prince and said flatly: “Take one strike? What’s hard about it? Go ahead, I’ll give you a chance.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince nearly vomited blood from anger due to Li Qiye’s nonchalant attitude. Even though he wasn’t a match for a supreme genius like Long Aotian, he was still among the top of the young generation at the Grand Sea. Even the older generation wouldn’t treat him lightly but now, Fiercest’s attitude towards him was all too humiliating.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very well, I’ll see how strong you are!” The prince roared while blinded by fury.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xsh!” He pulled back the string and gathered the momentum. The bow was full of power as if its user was channeling the power of the world itself!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawr!” Once the string was pulled back all the way, a dragon roar suddenly resounded. A totem of a golden dragon appeared behind the prince and seemingly took over his body. The aura of man and dragon using together surged and transformed him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a reason why people called him the Golden Dragon Prince. His bloodline was precious with this type of totem. When it appeared, it would grant him an explosive power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bow also changed color and became resplendent with the emergence of a golden arrow.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” The arrow finally rushed out with an incredible speed, capable of shooting down the sun in the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It instantly fixated onto Li Qiye. It wouldn’t matter where he ran, he wouldn’t be able to escape this arrow. The terrifying part was its incomparable sharpness, capable of piercing through everything. Even the best armors and protection artifacts wouldn’t be able to stop it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bow left behind by a Heavenly Demon and used by an expert at the Heavenly God level had palpable power. God-Monarchs would fall prey to it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Contrary to everyone’s expectation, Fiercest didn’t bother evading the shot with his amazing speed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, time seemed to have been frozen. One could see Fiercest reaching out with one finger and touched the arrow.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud explosion occurred when the two entities collided. The arrow immediately shattered into golden powders that scattered everywhere.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ferocious attack from the prince was dispelled so easily by Fiercest to the astonishment of the crowd. The prince was aghast as well. His mind became empty as he instinctively took one step back!</span></p><div id="footnote-233b"><p>1.
