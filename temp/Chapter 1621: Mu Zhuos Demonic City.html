The big fish is out already, the baits don’t matter anymore.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand.” Ye Jiuzhou nodded respectfully.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It will be quite a show. I wonder how many old men from Soaring Immortal will come out to join the fun? I hope they will go all out.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will Soaring Immortal take the bait too?” Jiuzhou became worried: “They still have old generals that recognize His Excellency Dark Crow.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Gu Zun was certain and said: “While they are still resting, we’ll exacerbate the situation. By that point, Soaring Immortal can’t escape even if they want to.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What if they surrender like last time? That might save them again.” Jiuzhou commented.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, it’s different now.” Gu Zun disagreed: “Back then, those old geezers knew what kind of existences they were facing. Even Immortal Emperor Qian Li and the Black Dragon King were there as well. They had no choice but to give up. That’s not the case anymore. The younger generation might not know about him. Even if they have heard of some legends, they won’t keep it in mind at all."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thick smile appeared on his face as he continued: “This is especially true for Ancestor Long. He has been itching to come out and play. In the past, this was a supreme genius with a grand completion physique at a young age. He was undergoing some training in the nine worlds to become the emperor eventually. Alas, he was born in the wrong period. Soaring Immortal had to close its doors so he lost the chance to become emperor. This had always haunted him so now, as one of the leaders of the Ren Xian branch and the young faction, his ambition is burning strong, wanting to fight and unite the nine worlds.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you think those young ones want to compromise so easily? They possess enough strength so do you think they care for a legend? They believe that legends are meant to be broken; with that, they will become the new legend!” He smiled after stating this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiuzhou sighed after hearing his master: “Master, do they have a chance of winning?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Zun shook his head: “No. Soaring Immortal has five emperors, two of them were under his banner. If he were to attack Soaring Immortal, he’ll have certain things that Soaring Immortal won’t be ready for.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about you, master?” Next came the important question.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Zun pondered for a moment before his eyes flashed with a sharp, cold glint - capable of tearing the world apart. He eventually withdrew the gaze and looked at his disciple: “Jiuzhou, If you are afraid, then withdraw, I won’t blame you. You’re not the only one who is afraid of him in the generations. Even emperors are apprehensive, let alone others.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No.” Jiuzhou shook his head: “Master, I know who we are facing. As long as you don’t give up, I won’t either. My life is yours!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a shame for you too, being born in the wrong era or you would have a chance to become emperor too.” Gu Zun sighed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiuzhou didn’t respond. He chose to stand by his master despite the insurmountable odds. He knew that death was virtually impossible to escape but he had no regrets.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Zhuo’s Demonic City was a great lineage in the Grand Sea, among the top of the rankings.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was majestic with towering walls and spanned for ten thousands of miles. This gated region seemed to be its own world. It was an ancient and sacred city, especially in the heart of the demons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The city was prosperous with billions of inhabitants. It passed on for one generation after another with the same riches. They had to be praised for having the proper administration.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was considered an imperial lineage with an Immortal Emperor True Treasure with deep roots and considerable power, capable of contending against the imperial lineages in Mortal Emperor.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its status did indeed have something to do with its origin. It claimed to have the dao system of Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo as well as many of his great techniques. That’s why they considered themselves to be an orthodox branch. Their members also claimed to be his descendants.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There seemed to be no problem with the city taking this claim in regards to their dao system and bloodline. However, it was worth further deliberation on whether they were his orthodox lineage or not. It can even be said that this was a slight overstepping.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were very few writings about the emperor. Some people were sure that he didn’t pass down his system. Though the city had many arts from him, a few researchers found that he didn’t pass down h heavenly dao. In other words, he didn’t recognize the city as his lineage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The researchers didn’t disagree with the self-proclaimed notion that the city had many of his arts. All along, no one knew how many merit laws he had actually created. They didn’t even know what his supreme grand dao encompassed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, no other sects were known to have his arts. This was the reason why people accepted the city’s status so readily.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One couldn’t deny that the city consisted of his descendants. However, this didn’t mean that they had the direct line.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the lack of records, people knew that he had many lovers of high status including goddess, demoness, and saintesses before eventually settling down with the prettiest woman in one of the nine worlds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their child eventually lived in this city but the emperor has never spent a single day in this place. This was the amusing aspect about the whole thing. In other words, this city couldn’t actually be considered his main lineage, only a side branch.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His direct lineage disappeared along with him and the imperial queen. Their branch no longer showed themselves but people said that it did have successors. No one knew where they went.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the silence of the main branch, the demon city was able to claim this prestigious position without any backlash from the public.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of the claim’s validity, the city has always been prosperous and didn’t besmirch the emperor’s reputation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People busily came and went in this special place inside the demonic city today. Suddenly, a terrible and tyrannical aura loomed in the sky and engulfed the entire location.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mortals kneeled and cultivators rembled before this aura.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A supreme grand dao descended from the horizon. A grand path paved itself with countless immoral light.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavenly flowers and amazing trees were inside this light while the deer ran among them. When this grand dao appeared, it looked as if an immortal world was being opened.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, a person with a flawless temperament slowly approached just like an immortal from the upper realm!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His robe fluttered as he was being accompanied by the laws and hymns of the grand dao. He emitted a radiance akin to an ascension ceremony. All were waiting for his blessing; the myriad existences in the world prostrated before him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was above the nine heavens and looked down on the myriad realms and their inhabitants. In this particular moment, he solemnly assumed the role of an emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his eleven palaces emerged above his head, an undying might drowned the wold, giving him an insuperable position.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A primordial energy rained down with his steps as if he came from the origin of the world, the beginning of the grand dao.
