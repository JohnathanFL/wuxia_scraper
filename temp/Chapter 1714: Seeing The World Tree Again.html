Moreover, they have never been destroyed before.” Magu quietly added this time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled and said: “You’re right, but not completely. The former statement is true but we don’t know whether they have been destroyed or not. It’s too hard to tell because even if they were destroyed, they would appear with another form.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a moment and went on: “Say, this Void Gate right here, it had created a world. Maybe this world will be destroyed later due to many reasons but the gate will still exist, maybe in a different form several epochs later. At that point, maybe people will call it the Immortal Gate or something else instead.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The absolute beginning creates the nine words which give birth to the nine treasures which lead to the nine scriptures.” South Emperor stated: “As long as the nine words exist, so will the treasures and scriptures. Time and the world might change but the overarching existence won’t.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed.” Li Qiye nodded: “This is the reason why the nine treasures and nine scriptures&nbsp;are so tempting. It is not about their innate power and profundity, granting its master certain achievements but because it is an eternal part of the heaven and earth.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group gained a deeper understanding regarding these treasures after listening to Li Qiye and became more eager to see them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The nine scriptures aren’t necessarily the strongest merit laws in the world. One can even say that in terms of destructive potential, they are weaker than many other arts but they have a unique charm.” Li Qiye finished.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, the group was in awe of the beauty of this place. If one could create a sect in this location, their descendants would surely flourish.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can we establish lineages here?” South Emperor wondered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course.” Li Qiye smiled: “This is an unexplored world that needs the myriad races from the nine world to excavate. The riches here are for everyone but they must follow the rules. As long as it is permitted, anything is possible.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like our Mysterious Bamboo Mountain will need a branch here.” South Emperor became tempted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The godfiend and Old Xian shared this sentiment as well. If their sect could start a branch here, it would bring about unlimited potential.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Li Qiye allowed for this since the world required the sects to populate it. With the place flourishing, the nine worlds will have more hope in the future and enough power to fight the Ancient Ming.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, they made it to the source of this world’s power. It was boundless like space. The entire location was being hidden under a great tree.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye couldn’t be more familiar with it. It was the World Tree. While looking up at it, everyone felt so tiny. It was blotting out the entire area with its unfathomable height. Not to mention a person, even a star paled in comparison. Just one leaf alone could uphold a star.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stars around it decorated the tree like beautiful diamonds. The existence of the tree shielded the area, not allowing anyone to step inside the source of power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and decided to experiment by activating his four physiques. His power erupted as he took a step forward, wishing to infiltrate the area.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” But even under the state of his four physiques in action, he still couldn’t get in. An endless power blew him flying for more than one thousand miles before he could stabilize.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group was astounded by this scene. South Emperor blurted: “The power here is actually this strong?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t completely convinced. Thus, he roared and channeled his energy. An explosive forced aimed straight for the World Tree.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The area quaked. He mustered all of his strength but still failed to destroy the barrier created by the World Tree.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like it’s impossible for me.” He smiled wryly while shaking his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye commented: “This is still the power of the Void Gate and everything here. Not just you, even emperors can’t do it or they would have something above the power of the nine.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">South Emperor felt better after hearing this. After all, the nine treasures were unique and to a certain extent, they represented the primordial power since they were born in there. Emperors weren’t above the absolute beginning, the source of all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do we get in then?” Bu Lianxiang asked after seeing that brute force was of no use.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Others cant.” Li Qiye smiled and the Ancient Void Rune flew out. With a clank, it fused with the tree, causing the whole thing to be flashing with light.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tree seemed to be waking up like an old friend waving at Li Qiye’s group.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let us go.” Li Qiye told the group.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering, the others were astonished by what they saw so they stood there frozen.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a vast space with the World Tree growing in the center. It took roots in the flowing galaxies. The most shocking thing was the primordial energy permeating this entire area. Meanwhile, worldly energy has turned into a great ocean with great waves, slamming into the stars.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This looked like the beginning of the world, the shape of the start. The phenomenon was ancient and unreachable in terms of time yet it was also inches from them. Any existence wouldn’t be able to describe their emotion while standing here. They were witnessing the world’s initial form.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many imperial lineages had ancestral grounds that were amazing enough to look down on the rest of the world. They had the best earth veins and mines but those were nothing compared to this world. This was a real treasure ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Xian emotionally blurted: “Whoever can grasp this will have resources beyond imagination.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“People can’t grasp this place, even if they are allowed to stay here. This is the power belonging to this world and the Void Zone. If you can grasp everything here, it means that you can also grasp the entire treasure.” Li Qiye shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group agreed with this statement since they couldn’t be above a heavenly treasure, no matter how strong they might be. Just slightly using it alone was amazing enough.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One would be invincible if they were allowed to stay here on top of slightly using the Void Zone’s power, at least in this place. Even if an emperor were to come in person, they wouldn’t be enough of a threat.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made it clear to the others why emperors wanted these heavenly treasures so much. It was indeed enough to drive someone crazy with greed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What kind of rules should be made?” Magu eventually asked after everyone calmed down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye said: “Our group isn't enough to create these rules, the power here is too much. We need help.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
