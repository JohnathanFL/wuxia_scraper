He looked up and a bright seal emerged on his forehead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Heaven’s Will seal!” A hawk-eyed fella could see and murmur.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a copious amount of experts gathering in Mortal Emperor, especially in this area. Even the unhappy Candidates Alliance was here.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The geniuses that were robbed of their eligibility were annoyed. One could even say that they were furious so some snorted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Li Qiye already grasped the invincible might of an Immortal Emperor, some geniuses were still not willing to accept this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their mind, they had been chosen by the Heaven’s Will before but the sudden and confusing loss left them unsatisfied.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching Li Qiye with his seal exasperated them even more.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha, the candidates all lost their qualification for some reason, even if he were to seize the Heaven’s Will right now, it’ll be a questionable ascension.” Someone mumbled but many heard him clearly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guy was purposely trying to put Li Qiye down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People glanced at each other, especially members of the alliance. These geniuses completely agreed with this sentiment. However, Li Qiye was too powerful at this moment so no one dared to speak up. Under his current state, even an Emperor Contender would be taken down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Step up if you’re going to say something. Don’t make me drag you out.” Li Qiye chuckled in response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.” Two people appeared out of nowhere, one old and one young, shrouded in a divine aura. Their vitality was quite holy and gave off a supreme feeling to all spectators as if they came from a divine race.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I said it.” The old man lowered his tone: “It doesn’t matter how strong you are. Without a competition, people will talk.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at the old man then the youth. He smiled: “And here I thought it was someone else. So it’s Unidao True God. Your bloodline is quite rare in the nine worlds. When your father was alive, he still could only kneel before me. You are far inferior compared to him.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” The old man’s face turned red.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine, since everyone is here, I won’t be so polite.” Li Qiye’s gaze swept through the experts, especially the alliance members and their dao protectors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the alliance wanted to go all out and challenge the new emperor’s authority so they were quite eager at the moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye said: “I initially wanted to be merciful, leaving more talents behind for the nine worlds but if all of you are so blind, don’t blame me for what I’m about to do next. Your alliance must be unhappy and feel indignation about losing your eligibility.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A battle has always been part of the ascension to the throne. Only by experiencing this would one be qualified to become emperor.” One candidate stated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right.” A different genius parroted: “It’s not an official ascension without a battle!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The quiet ones, especially the imperial lineages, were wanting to leave this mess. They had seen enough of Fiercest’s abilities. It couldn’t end well for those who oppose him. The best example was Soaring Immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, the alliance remained unconvinced and refused to swallow this indignation, despite knowing Fiercest’s strength.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine, you want a merciless battle for the Heaven’s Will, right? So be it. All come together with your dao protector and sects. I’ll take care of you all with just one move.” Li Qiye chuckled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The geniuses from the alliance were furious after hearing this. They were the top talents from all over the nine worlds with amazing achievements and personal abilities. Though they knew Li Qiye was untouchable, his declaration of taking them all down with one move was simply humiliating.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such a big tone!” One genius from a different world scowled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye replied: “I’ve always been like this. If you want to make a move, go for it. Don’t waste my time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure?” Another asked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right.” Li Qiye said: “Anyone who is unhappy with me can come with whatever techniques and methods. I will need just one move!”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine, we’ll just see how invincible you are!” The young was always impetuous. One of them instantly said after losing their patience.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, the alliance got ready for battle. Their dao protectors and seniors stepped up as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short time, Li Qiye was completely surrounded. Each genius took the most advantageous position in order to deliver the fatal blow.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anyone else? Let’s go then, the more the better so I can finish it all right away.” Li Qiye looked around and asked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” Some geniuses were hesitating at first but they couldn’t handle his arrogance. They snorted and stood out as well along with their seniors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the spectators and virtually everyone who was from Mortal Emperor retreated far away from the battlefield.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those from Mortal Emperor could already see the incoming destruction. There was nothing Fiercest couldn’t do in their mind, no miracle he couldn’t perform. In fact, even miracles seemed so commonplace when he was involved. If he said that he could destroy the alliance with one move, then he was definitely going to do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, the alliance was in position for this final chance. There was no other choice but to test the might of Fiercest. They all walked on the path of the heavens and Immortal Emperor was their goal. If they didn’t risk everything at this last second, then their several dozen years or even several hundred years of cultivation would be wasted!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though testing the beast was an unwise move since Li Qiye was unstoppable with his thirteen palaces and four physiques; rationality didn’t exist before the Heaven’s Will. What was the point of all the hard training and spilled blood? They all paid the price and toiled just for this competition. This last effort gave meaning to their lifelong pursuit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, they had the number advantage at this moment. If they could take Fiercest down, there was still a chance of reaching for the throne.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was their biggest obstacle and there was no way around it. They must kill him or everything would only be empty talks.</span></p>
