<p>If this was brought to light, it would be an act of traitorous treason against the sect. Only a crazy person or a fool would do such a thing. Protector Mo felt like he belonged to one of those two groups. However, his intuition told him that in the future, they would have unlimited potential if they were to follow this thirteen year old boy. However, in the end, this was only based on intuition.</p><p>Nan Huairen’s heart was startled as well. This was a very significant life choice, and his master had already chosen his destiny. Nan Huairen knew what his answer would be: “With just one word from senior, and I will jump through any fire and water without hesitation!”</p><p>Nan Huairen said in an utmost and serious manner after heavy inhaling.</p><p>Before, when he called Li Qiye “senior”, it had a different meaning. It was because it was part of the sect’s custom. Now, the word “senior” had a different connotation.</p><p>A thirteen year old almost turned the Nine Saint Demon Gate upside down, he dared to underestimate the Elders that were crowned Royal Nobles, and he was able to speak calmly in front of the Demon King! Other people would think Li Qiye was too arrogant, or he did not know his own strength; however, that was because they did not see him traversing the Chaotic Heart Forest and killing Protector Hua and his disciple. Nan Huairen understood that other people’s perception of Li Qiye was completely inaccurate.</p><p>Li Qiye, as the Prime Disciple of Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, dared to kill a Protector and asked for the Nine Saint Demon Gate’s princess to be a maid. He had already planned everything before stepping into the Nine Saint Demon Gate, knowing that he could walk out unscathed.</p><p>Nan Huairen was very smart, and he thought about it carefully. Even if he tried his hardest his whole life, his peak would be becoming an Elder for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Maybe Li Qiye’s appearance would change his destiny.</p><p>Seeing these two join his ranks, Li Qiye nodded his head and boldly announced: “One day, you two will understand how wise of a decision you have made today.”</p><p>“What should we report when we return to the sect?” Protector Mo prudently asked. The events linked to the trial and marriage have too much significance; he did not know what was okay to say.</p><p>Li Qiye smiled at Protector Mo and answered: “If Elder Yun wants to speak with you, then in my opinion, you should do the following…”</p><p>What Li Qiye told him to do made Protector Mo feel uneasy. Before their departure, the First Elder of the Nine Saint Demon Gate had met him and asked that the story regarding the Heavenly Guardians be kept a secret. At that moment, Protector Mo had not agreed to the request.</p><p>“I understand.” Protector Mo knew what he should and shouldn’t say as long as the chosen rhetoric benefitted him and Li Qiye.</p><p>Finally, the three of them left the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Grand Protector Yu He personally went to see them off. In recent times, no one from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had ever received such an honor.</p><p>The gateway was opened, and the portal between the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and Nine Saint Demon Gate activated. Finally, the group of three had returned home. After leaving the temple, they took a deep breath and basked in the heavenly spirits of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; they thought about the events that transpired and felt like they had just woken up from a dream.</p><p>***</p><p>Returning to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, as the one who was leading the trip for the trial between the two sects, Protector Mo immediately went to meet the Six Elders to give his report. Li Qiye went back to his mountain peak.</p><p>Li Qiye stood quietly on top of his peak, overlooking the entirety of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He remembered when Immortal Emperor Min Ren was still alive; the area of the sect spanned a million miles, and its refined energy was as expansive as the ocean.</p><p>Now, not only had the area governed by the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect decreased, but its refined energy from the surroundings was slowly drying. Anyone standing in this land would feel that the world essence of the sect had become very thin.</p><p>Today, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was like a flickering candle in the wind or an elderly man that could meet his end at any moment.</p><p>Li Qiye sighed in his heart. He did not pick the Heaven Protector City or the War God Temple; not even the Nine Saint Demon Gate. He ultimately chose the ever declining Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>As aforementioned, he did not like the previous Sect Masters of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. That year, he hoped that Min Ren would pick a different disciple to become the next Sect Master, even when this disciple’s talents were not as strong as the first disciple. Li Qiye valued him greatly for his character instead. Unfortunately, after he woke up from his deep slumber, he found that the first disciple had became the new Sect Master and proclaimed his sect to be the traditional orthodox sect.</p><p>Li Qiye had never liked the type of people who considered themselves as the only ones who were orthodox, which was why he had never returned to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect or cared about its ups and downs.</p><p>However, in this era, where he had regained his true body, it was fateful that the first person he met was Old Devil from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Li Qiye had single-handedly taught Min Ren; in a sense, he was the true creator of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He was confident that he could reignite its old glory. One day, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, under his command, would sweep through the heavens and earth, reigning over the Nine Worlds.</p><p>Li Qiye was so lost in his thoughts that he did not notice Nan Huairen’s arrival.</p><p>“Senior, the Elders wish to see you.” Nan Huairen waited until Li Qiye was finished contemplating before he spoke.</p><p>Li Qiye slightly nodded his head and followed Nan Huairen into the Grand Chamber. The Six Elders had gathered there beforehand, and all of them had their eyes set on Li Qiye.</p><p>The atmosphere in the Grand Chamber suddenly became strangely dignified and calm. Everyone had their own thoughts.</p><p>The Six Elders previously had heard Protector Mo’s report on the events regarding the trials, but Protector Mo did not reveal everything. He concentrated on Li Qiye’s passing through the Chaotic Heart Forest, he purposely left the fight with Xu Hui intentionally vague, he did not mention the Serpent Punishing Stick, or Li Qiye’s control of the four Heavenly Guardians. In the end, he even concluded that Li Qiye’s victory over Xu Hui was pure luck.</p><p>“You have successfully passed the trial?” The First Elder formally asked Li Qi ye. The truth was, the Six Elders did not have any confidence regarding this arranged marriage, but the impossible had happened. Li Qiye passed the trial, but the more surprising detail was that he could go through the Chaotic Heart Forest.</p><p>Li Qiye ignored the serious atmosphere in the chamber, and exclaimed: “Honorable Elder, that is right! It seems like I should be getting the rewards promised to me, yes?”&nbsp;</p><p>“Of course there will be rewards, but I need you to explain one thing.” First Elder inquired: “From what I’ve heard, Xu Hui was a renown young disciple from the Nine Saint Demon Gate. His cultivation was the same as a sectional leader in our sect. You just joined our sect and had never cultivated before, how did you manage to defeat him?”</p><p>“Honorable Elder, Merit Laws are complex; martial arts are simple. I practiced the “Invisible Dual Blade” technique in a strange manner; as long as the opponent revealed a weakness in their defense, he will immediately receive a death blow. When it comes to a life and death battle, the brave person will win.” Li Qiye calmly answered.</p><p>“Nonsense!” An Elder named Xiong suddenly yelled and coldly continued:</p><p>“A mortal proclaiming that he had killed a Heaven’s Mandate cultivator through sheer techniques is ridiculous.” This Elder Xiong before had supported Li Qiye; however, today, he spoke coldly, and he was even unhappy; the before and after was like the sky against the depths. <a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></p><p>Li Qiye looked at Elder Xiong and spoke slowly: “Dear Elder, I had only spoken the truth. What other people can’t do does not mean that I can’t as well.”</p><p>He then looked at the remaining Elders in the room: “Dear Elders, today, I am a hero from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. If the Elders truly think that I had cheated in some way, then you guys can question the people who saw it with their own eyes; people like Protector Mo or the people of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.”</p><p>“All of the Elders know, in your hearts, that this trip to the Nine Saint Demon Gate was dangerously ominous. By going to the Nine Saint Demon Gate, we were essentially going to our own demise. However, because of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s reputation, even if I were to lose my life, I would have done the same again. Today, I come back as a hero. what is the reasoning behind your suspicions of me? This is how you treat a hero? If this is the reality, then the people’s hearts will become cold; who will want to sacrifice themselves for the sect anymore?” Li Qiye paused a moment and then he went on: “Before our departure, we had an agreement; do you honorable Elders wish to retract your words? If that is the case, then I can only say my joining of this sect was a mistake. Our Cleansing Incense Ancient Act is of Immortal Emperor lineage for many era; if the elders are not true to their words, then how can we remain trustworthy as a sect?”</p><p>“Whether our sect is trustworthy or not, it is not up to you to comment.” An Elder loudly yelled.</p><p>Li Qiye ignored the reaction of this Elder and kept going on: “I risked my life going into the Nine Saint Demon Gate and came out with a complete success. If the Elders carried out the promise from that day without accusing me of lying, I would not be criticizing. Otherwise, I will cry ‘unfair’ because the success of this trip was potentially traded with my life.”</p><p>Finished speaking, Li Qiye coldly glared at the Six Elders.</p><p>“You have said too much!” At this moment, an Elder coughed. His expression contained a little bit of shame.</p><p>The First Elder started speaking: "Li Qiye, it is not that we wanted to berate you; the thing is, this whole thing is just a little strange. Let’s set aside the Xu Hui thing; I want to hear how you successfully passed the Chaotic Heart Forest.”</p><p>The First Elder’s eyes brightened up and stared at Li Qiye as if he wanted to see through the little boy.</p><p><span class="footnote" id="footnote_1">[1] This is another proverb, comparing the two great extremes.</span></p>
