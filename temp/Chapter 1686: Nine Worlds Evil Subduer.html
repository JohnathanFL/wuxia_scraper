Even though all of this required considerable words to describe, it all happened within a split second.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bony sword aiming for Li Qiye was stopped due to a spear appearing out of nowhere. Li Qiye wielded it with many grand dao accompanying it. Each grand dao represented an Immortal Emperor, mostly from the Emperors Era. Even Immortal Emperor Ta Kong was there!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This spear represented the emperors’ battle intent and the nine worlds’ inhabitants’ will. It was meant to create the nine worlds, residing in every inch of the land and everyone’s heart.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Like I said, show no mercy to those who conspire with the Ancient Ming! Watch, no matter where you are hiding, open your dog eyes! The nine worlds are eternally protected, get the hell out!” His merciless voice filled the world with the stench of blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone would shiver before his cold and bloodthirsty glare; even Immortal Emperors were no exception.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff!” He instantly threw the spear towards the imperial queen.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” Her miserable scream should come as no surprise. She was instantly pinned to the ground despite having the power of an Emperor Rival. There was no resisting this weapon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her wails of torment echoed around the world. She struggled, aiming to pull the spear out of her body. However, it was useless. Universal laws were locking her body and slowly refining and separating her body. Her holy light dimmed down along with her sacred breath. The initially white-as-snow blood began to change to reveal its true darkness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The nine worlds aren’t meant for you, Ancient Ming!” Li Qiye glanced at the queen without any mercy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention the queen, even a real emperor would be dead for sure. As long as the victim had the bloodline of an Ancient Ming, there was no escaping!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-d01b"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Worlds’ Evil Subduer! This was the name of this spear but it wasn’t actually a weapon. It was a sure-kill move, created from an accumulation of wills and power from the earth.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-d01b">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its existence was to protect the nine worlds from the Ancient Ming!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the end of the Ancient Ming Era, this race wasn’t completely wiped out because it had the Corporeal Zone. They still had extremely powerful overlords hiding within. Even Li Qiye himself was helpless against this artifact, truly headache inducing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he couldn’t always stay in the nine worlds. Without sufficient preparation, the Ancient Ming could always come back to make the nine worlds its victim.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, as the Dark Crow, Li Qiye had a grand plan. He signed a supreme agreement and Immortal Emperor Min Ren carried it out first.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After spending countless efforts of preparing the nine worlds, Li Qiye also had Immortal Emperor Min Ren and Empress Hong Tian start by refining and empowering the nets around the nine worlds. Later on, each successive generation of emperors would do the same to create this sure-kill move.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the ultimate method of dealing with the Ancient Ming in case they were to come back again. At the very least, the inhabitants of the nine worlds could use this to try and stop them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t under Li Qiye’s control but rather, everyone in the world could wield this “spear” as long as they had a will to fight against the Ancient Ming to the very last drop of blood!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” The four siblings screamed after seeing their mother pinned to the ground and groaning. Alas, they couldn’t do anything either.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your turn!” Li Qiye shifted his gaze towards the four. The lightning bolts jumped frantically into their body and instantly removed all of their blood and cultivation. They used these essences to refine their four inner physiques.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” The four princes howled and were instantly burnt to a crisp. Meanwhile, their inner physiques were refined into the best physique essences using the power of the heavenly tribulation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” The queen shrieked after being forced to watch her children turn into nothingness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li, I will haunt you forever!” The queen screamed with a twisted expression and no longer had any semblance of her regal self.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye said coldly: “Many Ancient Mings cursed me like that when I massacred them back then. Haunt me? So what, you will still be kneeling before me then!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, he ignored the queen. With a popping sound, the essences of the four inner physiques instantly fused with his own.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” In the blink of an eye, his four inner physiques became dazzling. They spewed out immortal light and Li Qiye suddenly became magnificent. The black light of Hell Suppression, the wondrous light of Soaring Immortal, the purity of Void Imperfection, and immense power of Sky Destroyer; all four annihilated the world. Nothing could restrain Li Qiye any longer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, his four physiques have finally reached grand completion. When his eyes became bright, everything shivered in fear, even emperors if they were to see this sight!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s finally done, four Immortal Physiques, one and only in history.” The matriarch was astonished to see this. In the past, the Black Dragon King was already unbeatable with just two but now, His Excellency had four. Immortal Emperors certainly weren’t his match any longer!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Gu Zun gently sighed. He knew he had lost at this point. All of his remaining ace cards were useless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Saints, don’t forget your promise!” The queen shouted in despair at the horizon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye at this time posed coolly with both hands behind his back. His eyes resembled two divine lamps illuminating every single coordinate in the world!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, regardless of her screaming, the sky was still the same as before. It was as if she was only talking to herself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a shame, they still won’t take action. You’re only a pawn in their eyes.” Li Qiye coldly told the queen.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No! I am the only one in the world who had a successful blood evolution, they can’t abandon me!” She was in complete disbelief.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even Immortal Emperor Ren Xian abandoned you, let alone them. The man who loves you the most didn’t care, do you think the Ancient Ming would care about a mere pawn? Tell me their location, I might spare your life!” He said coldly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, no, Ren Xian would never abandon me!” The woman drowned in despair murmured to herself and didn’t hear Li Qiye at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He became disappointed. The queen simply didn’t know the location of the Corporeal Zone at all. The Ancient Ming was too careful. In their eyes, they only had one chance so they must be certain of success. Otherwise, all they have done would be gone with the wind, especially their last hope, the Corporeal Zone. If they were to lose this artifact, their entire race would be completely wiped out!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky remained quiet. There was no sign of any Ancient Ming, let alone the Corporeal Zone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gently sighed and knew that it wasn’t happening. After millions of years, he couldn’t wait till the last moment. Alas, he had no other choice because he no longer had eternal life and waited like before. He must keep on going in this generation instead of waiting for the Ancient Ming’s retaliation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing the queen’s group was only an early end to his plan. This was the last sweep before he left the nine worlds. It also served as a threat to the remnant Ancient Ming so that they wouldn’t dare to act recklessly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the future, whether the nine worlds could oppose the Ancient Ming or not, that was up to them. He had done all he could. He would continue forward without caring or protecting the nine worlds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, he shifted his gaze towards Gu Zun who was still standing calmly there. Li Qiye could see his own image on Gu Zun. The guy had indeed learned many things from him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s unfortunate that the opportunity you were waiting for didn’t come.” Li Qiye shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Zun knew that he had lost and said seriously: “I know. I also feel sorry for you, Your Excellency. The Ancient Ming still doesn’t dare to take action, not biting down on such a tempting bait. Looks like they’re giving up on their best pawn.”</span></p><div id="footnote-d01b"><p>1. The full name is, Nine Worlds Inhabitants’ Evil Subduing Spear.
