<p><b>&nbsp;Chapter 151 : Underworld Boat Coming into Being (1)</b></p><p>The Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground was referred to as the largest cemetery by the people in the Grand Middle Territory! Countless grand characters were buried there. As for the nameless ones, no one knew for sure.</p><p>Legends has it that countless people were buried there, ranging from the nameless to Heavenly Kings and Virtuous Paragons. There was even a rumor that this place even buried Immortal Emperors!</p><p>No one knew whether this rumor was true or not. However, as one of the twelve burial grounds in this world, it was the place where many dying cultivators all gathered to find a great place with powerful feng shui to bury themselves.</p><p>The most fascinating and tempting story was about the possibility for rebirth inside the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground. Legends has it that if one could bury themselves in a Feng Shui Treasure Earth, they would be able to have a chance for a rebirth, or even a chance for eternal life.</p><p>As for what the Feng Shui Treasure Earth was, no one really knew for sure. This was all due to luck. After millions of years had passed, countless grand characters were buried inside, so even if there was Feng Shui Treasure Earth that was able of giving a second chance, they had long been accounted for.</p><p>However, for every person, there was still another chance in this burial ground, and it was the legendary Underworld Boat!</p><p>In every age in the legends, the Underworld River would come out from the earth under the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground. When it appeared, many Underworld Boats would come out along the Underworld River. Finally, they would follow the river all the way to the deepest part of the burial ground.</p><p>If a dying person was able to climb up the Underworld Boat and be buried inside, then they might be able to prolong their life, or even be reborn once again!</p><p>Even though this sounded crazy, the reality was that there were people who climbed up the Underworld Boats and were able to extend their lives as well as being reborn!</p><p>Because of this, for dying men, the Underworld Boat — along with the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground — was filled with temptations. Cultivators, Heavenly Kings, and even the invincible Virtuous Paragons would all eventually die in the end. They all feared returning to the yellow earth, so they had to take this step. This burial ground brought hope to the dying men, especially the old monsters in the great sects and powerful nations that hoped to be reborn.</p><p>“In this era, I will bet on being reborn!”</p><p>At last, these old monsters were no longer able to wait and started to come into being as their blood and life were reaching their ends.</p><p>The Underworld Boat quickly became the hot topic in all of the Mortal Emperor World, and dao gateways were opening everywhere as experts set foot into the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground.</p><p>This news also traveled to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>Nan Huairen was the most excited after hearing this news. He quickly went to find Li Qiye and said:</p><p>“Oldest Brother, I heard that the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground buried countless Virtuous Paragons. The items buried with them are the world’s immortal treasures. Hehe, at this moment, everyone is going to this burial ground. Should we follow as well to obtain some of the world’s immortal treasures?”</p><p>“The Underworld Boat is appearing!”</p><p>Li Qiye narrowed his eyes and essentially didn’t hear anything Nan Huairen said. He murmured:</p><p>“Rebirth, ah. Who in this era will be able to be reborn?”</p><p>The life prolonging of the Underworld Boat, or even rebirth, was not a false legend. This was the truth, and Li Qiye had seen — with his own eyes — people being reborn!</p><p>“Heh, Oldest Brother, should we lead some people into the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground to grab some treasures?”</p><p>Nan Huairen still ecstatically asked Li Qiye.</p><p>At this time, Li Qiye glanced at Nan Huairen and said:</p><p>“Grabbing some treasures? With just you? Any random corpse would be able to tear you into pieces.”</p><p>“Heh, with Big Brother by my side, I have no fear anywhere.”</p><p>Nan Huairen cheekily said. He had blind confidence regarding Li Qiye.</p><p>“Even if I go, I wouldn’t let you come along!”</p><p>Li Qiye angrily said.</p><p>Nan Huairen forced a smile and said:</p><p>“Heh, Oldest Brother, you don’t really care about bringing another person. Well, if you really go, you have to bring me along for sure.”</p><p>Li Qiye glared at him and shook his head:</p><p>“Even if I actually go, I wouldn’t bring you along. The Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground is much more terrifying than the Evil Infested Ridge. This is not a place that anyone can go to! Your cultivation is not bad, but as for your Physique… Once tainted by corpse poison, if light, then you would stay in bed for a few years; if bad, then you would turn into an Earth Corpse!”</p><p>“Turning into an Earth Corpse!”</p><p>Hearing this, Nan Huairen had the creeps and his head shrunk into his body as a cold chill ran behind his back. He couldn’t help but lose his colors and say:</p><p>“I heard that an Earth Corpse was no different than a zombie. Both are monsters that cannot eat nor drink.”</p><p>“There is a difference, an Earth Corpse is a living existence.”</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and said:</p><p>“If it is lucky, then it could have a little sense to find a Feng Shui Treasure Earth to bury itself and wait. After hundreds of thousands of years, it would be able to be reborn once again.”</p><p>“My mother, I don’t need any of that. I am alive and well at this moment, and I don’t want to be a corpse buried underground.”</p><p>Nan Huairen changed his expression and no longer dared to discuss the matter of the burial ground. He quickly left soon after.</p><p>After Nan Huairen’s departure, Li Qiye looked at the far horizon towards the area of the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground and became quiet for a long time!</p><p>The Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground — Li Qiye gently sighed in his heart. This was one of the twelve burial grounds, the paradise of the dead. Many cultivators wanted to flock to this place, ah.</p><p>When he was the Dark Crow, he went to this burial many times in the last hundreds of thousands of years. One could even say that he no longer remembered how many times he had entered it.</p><p>To say that it was dangerous, then it wasn’t dangerous. But to say that it wasn’t dangerous, then it was very dangerous. Even an Immortal Emperor in person wouldn’t dare to carelessly tread into its deepest part!</p><p>The most important thing when entering was the intention. The deepest part of the burial ground was not for anyone, not even for Immortal Emperors. Virtuous Paragons would only be courting death at that place.</p><p>“You want to go?”</p><p>Seeing Li Qiye stunned in silence, Chen Baojiao went next to his side. She had heard of information about this burial ground, and seeing Li Qiye stare towards it in a daze, she couldn’t help but to ask.</p><p>Always being around Li Qiye, Chen Baojiao was gradually getting used to Li Qiye’s thoughts and patterns.</p><p>“Go, go and see.”</p><p>Li Qiye finally nodded his head and said:</p><p>“The path to the heavenly road will appear, and the godly stones will open! I have to take a trip to this place.”</p><p>There was something he wanted at the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground!</p><p>In reality, there was something that he coveted for a long time. He sent people there before as well, but it was not successful. This time, he intended to personally go.</p><p>“There is something there that is suitable for you as well.”</p><p>Li Qiye turned towards Chen Baojiao and said.</p><p>Even though Chen Baojiao’s innate talents were not as great as Li Shuangyan and that she was very hot-headed, she was a very determined and arduous girl. Her effort on the road of cultivation was not less than anyone, including even Li Shuangyan. Li Qiye truly liked this aspect of her.</p><p>“The Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground — I heard that this is a place with zombies everywhere and countless Earth Corpses. The tyrants entrenched in the Feng Shui Treasure Earth were even more frightening. We shouldn’t go to this place, or we might carelessly become Earth Corpses.”</p><p>Chen Baojiao emotionally asked:</p><p>“Can we actually go to a place like this?”</p><p>“Once inside, unless one is so unreasonable powerful, one would need special methods. Otherwise, forcefully entering would be prohibitively difficult, not to mention going into the Feng Shui Treasure Earth of those tyrants.”</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and said.</p><p>Seeing Li Qiye’s confidence, Chen Baojiao didn’t say anything else. She was a maid, so she naturally would follow Li Qiye’s decision.</p><p>While Li Qiye was wondering about when to enter the burial ground, Li Shuangyan found him.</p><p>“The Nine Saint Demon Gate accepted a business proposal, I don’t know if you are interested or not?”</p><p>Li Shuangyan went straight to the point.</p><p>“What kind of business? Is it relating to the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground?”</p><p>Li Shuangyan nodded her head and said:</p><p>“Yes, there is someone wanting to be buried in an Underworld Boat. My master wanted this business since it is extremely important to the Nine Saint Demon Gate, but my master did not have the ability to do this so he thought about you. He believes that you can create a miracle.”</p><p>“Who is the partner?”</p><p>Li Qiye looked at Li Shuangyan and asked:</p><p>“Without your recommendation, I’m afraid your Nine Saint Demon Gate would not be so active like this.”</p><p>Li Shuangyan didn’t try to hide it and boldly said:</p><p>“I mentioned it to Master. No one could do this task better than you, so Master asked if you would be willing to accept this deal?”</p><p>“Who wants to be buried in the Underworld Boat?”</p><p>Li Qiye narrowed his eyes and slowly asked.</p><p>“A person from the War God Temple!”</p><p>Li Shuangyan truthfully said:</p><p>“It can be said that this person is extremely important to the Nine Saint Demon Gate. If he was successfully buried in an Underworld Boat, to you and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, there will be great benefits.”</p><p>“The old men in the War God Temple still haven’t given up, ah.”</p><p>Li Qiye slowly continued:</p><p>“After that old devil was successfully buried that year, all of the old men later became crazy and wanted to follow in suit, but no one had been successful, afterwards.”</p><p>“The War God Temple had someone who was successful?”</p><p>Li Shuangyan was a bit shocked to hear Li Qiye’s words.</p><p>“To be exact, they had an old devil who was reborn for another life after a successful burial.”</p><p>Li Qiye leisurely continued:</p><p>“Unfortunately, his luck was a little bit lacking. Otherwise, he would have become an Immortal Emperor with his two lives.”</p><p>“The Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground really allowed for someone to resurrect? To be brought back to life again?”</p><p>Li Shuangyan’s breath became faster. Even though she had heard many legends about this burial ground, she always thought that resurrection was only a legend, or an exaggeration.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
