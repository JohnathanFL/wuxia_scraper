The entire world was drowned in a blink.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, the withered tree was nowhere to be found. Only a verdant version emerged before the world and covered everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just one leaf alone was monstrous in size. The new tree couldn’t be measured by any conventional means since it was several times larger than the dead version. Moreover, the branches were much more numerous with countless leaves growing from them. Each leaf was already unimaginably large, the size of a mountain or a plain.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, this boundless vitality pervaded Heaven Spirit and bathed its inhabitants. Everyone felt relaxed as if they were several thousand years younger.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it obtaining immortality?” Everyone became emotional while immersed in this life force.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the tree returning to its peak form with the Death Chapter, not a type of rebirth. It was simply harkening back to its past life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Time to end this.” Li Qiye’s voice echoed across the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” Gigantic dragons rushed out from the Spirit Abyss right away and made their appearance clear by howling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” They began to tear the abyss apart and pulled out the deepest location from this sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” This location filled with darkness was crushed into nothingness. All protection and seals were insignificant before these dragons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those aren’t dragons!” Upon a closer inspection, the masters would see that they were thick branches coming out of the earth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” A branch came down from the sky towards the primordial weapon floating above the abyss. This was an artifact engulfed in primordial chaos. Nevertheless, it still couldn’t escape from the tree’s suppression. The branch instantly coiled around this weapon and dragged it away from the abyss.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After it was taken away, a series of explosions happened. The abyss began to crumble into pieces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill!” Many ancestors and experts saw the artifact being dragged away. They wildly howled and rushed towards the branch in order to take it back for it was everything to their sect.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff!” Other branches shot down like arrows. The result was obvious. All of these ancestors and disciples were instantly killed including those who didn’t participate. They were skewered by the branches together into a string.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short period, the dead disciples were still confused. They didn’t even last one move before these branches.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh god!” The young and old at the abyss were scared out of their mind while running out of the abyss.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at these defenseless people and didn’t try to kill him. He intended on sparing the young and old or they wouldn’t have made it outside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” The abyss was annihilated so quickly. Effort accumulated from many generations turned into ashes in the blink of an eye. This made Stygian scream and rushed out from the terra.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was too late. Another branch descended and nailed him to death in the sky. His blood dripped down one drop at a time to the ocean and slowly disappeared. It was an indignant death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their abyss has experienced countless generations using the advantage of Godhalt. Alas, it was all gone now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All eyes were wide open to see the Stygian Monarch being crucified up above.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” More detonations resounded with branches coming down and piercing through the Dream Empyrean.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Noooo!” The disciples there were massacred in the same manner. The young and old were spared but anyone else who has cultivated was killed!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang! Bang!” The Dream Empyrean was torn asunder. The branches then dragged the antique item away as well as the sect’s treasury.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Shen Mengtian inside the Ancestral Terra cried out and soared to the sky to kill these branches. That was the only thing on his mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” His resistance was futile since he was also nailed to the sky by one of the branches just like Stygian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rustle!” A thick branch coiled towards the direction of the fleeing Roaring Conch and instantly stopped it from moving.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do not resist, abandon ship!” Ling Fengyun was horrified as well. He used his top speed to rush towards the conch and yelled sternly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…” A few ancestors hesitated. How could they give up their home so easily?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff!” Screams came about. All of the ancestors and experts who either hesitated or resisted were skewered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Ling Fengyun couldn’t save them. He could only watch these resisting members die.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We might have an agreement but there is no mercy for those who do not obey.” Li Qiye’s voice loomed in the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave.” Ling Fengyun couldn’t change the situation. He swept his sleeve and brought all the lucky survivors out of the Roaring Conch. This was a supreme technique that could instantly send them to safety.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no turning the tide. This isn’t something you can resist. Now, be a normal person and find peace for the rest of your lives.” Fengyun gently sighed and left the refugees since his fate was up to Li Qiye now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The branch pulled the Roaring Conch back. This gigantic ship was now in Li Qiye’s possession.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, three great lineages have been eliminated from history. However, the Roaring Conch had a much better result compared to the Spirit Abyss and the Dream Empyrean. Though Li Qiye spared the weak, all of the other disciples and ancestors were massacred completely. However, only a few experts from the Roaring Conch were killed. More than ninety percent of its disciples managed to stay alive.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was due to Ling Fengyun’s wise decision. If he didn’t surrender and chose to fight like his peers, the Conch would have ended in the same way as the other two sects.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, the ship itself was no more so they have lost their ancestral ground and resources. Furthermore, like Fengyun has said, they needed to live a quiet life from now on since they have lost the chance to rise to domination in the future.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This slightly acceptable outcome was given to them by Ling Fenyun. Otherwise, they would have opposed him and that would end with their destruction!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short time, all of Heaven Spirit became quiet. Not to mention ordinary ancestors, even Godkings pissed their pants. Their legs grew weak as they stared at the gigantic tree.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Time to finish this.” Li Qiye chuckled while everyone else held their breath. After the destruction of these three sects, it was the Ancestral Terra’s turn.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha! I’ll take you on!” Dualchild laughed and left the Ancestral Terra. He understood that the three ancestral trees won’t be able to protect even themselves so he might as well die an early death instead of prolonging this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You shall get one move.” Li Qiye answered: “When my tree is at its peak, even your father would have to take the long way around, let alone you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This verdant tree had an unbelievable power at its highest state. Even emperors would be apprehensive about fighting it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One move it is, I won’t be begging for mercy.” Dualchild crazily roared: “Die!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He poured the rest of his vitality and longevity blood onto the true treasure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A Heavenly Annihilation came out. It shattered the sky vault and severed many branches with an unfathomable might.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, this annihilation still couldn’t oppose the green tree. It instantly shattered this move and crucified Dualchild as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, unlike Shen Mengtian and Stygian, Dualchild died with his eyes closed.</span></p>
