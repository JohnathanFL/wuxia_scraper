Many experts held their breath waiting for the day to come.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It passed by quickly but it seemed like an eternity to these experts. Everyone wanted to know the result right away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the lineages and cultivators here understood that the fate of Heaven Spirit would change after this battle.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Li Qiye were to win, it meant that he was strong enough to deal with all of Heaven Spirit or even the nine worlds. Nothing could hinder his path if he could slay the five masters.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that point, both imperial lineages and sea god’s sects would have to lower their head and submit to his rule.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if the five masters were to win, it might be the start of an oligarchy. Heaven Spirit would be under the shadows of these masters for a long period.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, this battle will decide the fate of the world. There was a risk that it would end the golden era of Heaven Spirit as well because Zhentian has fallen. If Li Qiye were to die as well, it meant that Heaven Spirit would have to forfeit the competition for Immortal Emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had conflicting opinions about the outcome. Many sects that had relations with the Spirit Abyss, Roaring Conch, and the Ancestral Terra wanted Ling Fengyun’s group to win because it would be their time to reign afterward.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, a larger side hoped for Li Qiye’s victory since he would be able to usher in a new generation with Heaven Spirit being at the top of the nine worlds!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope that Li Qiye can create another miracle and kill the five masters to ascend to the throne.” A few charming spirit lineages were very hopeful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even some powers who supported Zhentian before wanted Li Qiye to come out victoriously in this earthshaking battle.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye’s victory is imminent!” The slogans could be heard around the world by his fans.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, some sects that did want Li Qiye to win didn’t dare to express it publicly out of fear for his strong opponents.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These five days tortured the experts of this world long enough despite passing by quickly. The entire world was waiting with great anticipation for the ultimate war.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Finally, the first to mobilize after the deadline was the Spirit Abyss from Godhalt. Moreover, they didn’t use a dao portal and directly crossed the world instead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like a huge fortress opening its icy doors. A cavalry rushed out like a tsunami and soared to the sky. The atmosphere was engulfed with a murderous chill. Darkness emerged as if a nightmare was assaulting the world and suffocating its inhabitants.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This cavalry consisted of several tens of thousands of troops. They were all wearing full suits of black armor so no one could see their face. A person was seated on a throne raised by eight old men among the cavalry.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This throne was pitch black as if it was created from a supreme draconic rune metal. The old man on top looked just like an untouchable godfiend.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His old face was covered with wrinkles, but his black hair betrayed his other features. It was actually shimmering with a black luster. His eyes were naturally black and flashing with darkness. When he opened his eyes, it resembled the opening of a dark world. This was a dark ruler, the harbinger of darkness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this wasn’t the most terrifying aspect. Despite being carried by others, everyone saw the illusion that this old man was one with the cavalry itself. The cavalry was an extension of his arms. He could freely control it as if it was part of his body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A knowledgeable ancestor felt a chill as he murmured: “That’s the legendary Stygian Legion from the abyss.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why does he want to take a legion along for this apex level battle? Such a legion can’t possibly stop Li Qiye.” A few juniors didn’t understand why the monarch brought along his legion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Blood energy, they will share blood energy.” An older ancestor explained: “Because it is such a high-level battle, he has to take his legion along. This will be an ultimate and ferocious battle. Their group is older with withered vitality and on the verge of death. After such a battle, even if they were to win, they would die from exerting too much strength after returning.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They want to borrow their juniors’ vitality?” A different youth was surprised.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s one way to put it, but it isn’t that simple.” The ancestor continued: “You can’t just use your juniors’ vitality even if they agree. Everyone’s vitality is different since they cultivate different merit laws. Forcefully fusing this type of blood energy would lead to contention and even qi deviation…</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for this Stygian Legion, it has been carefully trained while each disciple was hand-picked. Their cultivation laws are very specific as well. Some were even taught by the monarch so that their vitality could resonate with his own.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a bit before continuing: “Such a legion requires a great number of resources. Moreover, the cost of replacing a dead member would be quite unbelievable. Because of this, this legion can share their vitality with the monarch. It is the pillar of the Spirit Abyss, its strongest legion and ace.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monarch and his legion traveled forward with a magnificent and unstoppable momentum capable of slaying both gods and devils standing in their way.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Stygian Monarch left, it was Shen Mengtian’s turn. He was indeed from the Spirit Abyss since his actions coincided with the monarch.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” At the ancestral ground of the Dream Empyrean, a door was opened on the moon hanging in the sky. Two rows of experts dressed in white completely came out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, they numbered in the tens of thousands and filled the world with their boundless light.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aura of this legion was completely different from the Stygian Legion. They emitted a holy light as if they were the messengers of the divine race. When they appeared in the sky, holy totems showed up as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These totems seemingly bathed Heaven Spirit in a holy light. A divine race was descending to the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next, Shen Mengtian came out of the moon. The astonishing part was that he only looked around forty instead of being old and feeble.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His aura wasn’t earth-shattering. On the contrary, he purposely hid it so he looked very scholarly. Nevertheless, each of his actions still seemed incredibly dominating as if he was the ruler of gods. He was born to be unreachable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t people saying that Shen Mengtian is on the verge of death? He looks so young right now, in the middle of his prime even.” Many were shocked to see his appearance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s only his flesh.” A big shot from the previous generation replied: “Once you are strong enough and open your heavenly gaze, you will find that below this vessel is a withering divinity and vitality. At his level, maintaining his external appearance isn’t difficult. It can’t hide his weakening true form though.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The junior understood after hearing this explanation. Even if he had opened his heavenly gaze, he still wouldn’t be able to see through anything because he wasn’t strong enough.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” Each expert in this legion opened their divine reflection and pointed it at the same source. Next, this ray of light instantly reached the Broken God Cliff and turned into a dao portal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The legion and Shen Mengtian disappeared right away and emerged again at the cliff in the next second.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was amazed by this scene because they haven’t seen a mobilization on this scale before.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s Shen Mengtian for you.” A supreme ancestor from the charming spirit race had to admit: “He has cultivated these divine reflections to the limit so he can do whatever he pleases.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many charming spirits became envious at this sight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are bringing their legions along to make up for their lack of vitality. Will Li Qiye be able to handle it?” Some people started to worry.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, all felt that Li Qiye’s biggest advantage was his youth and vigor as he could last longer than these two.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, even if he couldn’t kill them, he could drag out the battle until they died on their own. Alas, the legions they brought along solved this particular problem.</span></p>
