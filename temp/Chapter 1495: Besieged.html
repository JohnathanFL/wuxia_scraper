Even those who disliked him in the past had heartfelt admiration for his decision.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A charming spirit expert said: “A man should always tread forward without fear.” In the past, he was a supporter of Zhentian and hated Li Qiye. Alas, he couldn’t help but respect Li Qiye at this moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Li Qiye doesn’t die, the throne will surely be his in this generation.” The old charming spirit monarch sighed and said: “He has a supreme cultivation and a rock-solid dao heart on top of being fearless. These are the necessary qualities to become emperor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was hard for people to comment on whether an Immortal Emperor was good or bad. However, they do talk about the dao heart as the most essential requirement. As for the emperor’s morality, everyone had different opinions and standards. Only an unbreakable dao heart was the universal requirement.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye had arrived. He stared at Zhentian then looked around with a smile: “Come out, your stealth techniques aren’t bad, but they can’t fool my eyes.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” An army appeared and blocked off Li Qiye’s retreat, resulting in him being completely surrounded.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Terra Ancestor, the Prince of Darkness, and the Conch Overlord all appeared at the same time with a powerful legion behind each of them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a brief moment, the four leaders and their legions presided over the four directions and sealed the area as well as all possible paths of escape.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their vitality soared to the sky in a gallant yet murderous manner. Under the presence of such terrifying bloodthirst, the spectators nearby felt a chill.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are the strongest legions from the Spirit Abyss, Ancestral Terra, and Roaring Conch. It looks like all the elites from the abyss are here too.” Many experts couldn’t help but gasp.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But legions are useless when they reach this level.” Someone remained skeptical.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not necessarily.” The old monarch stared at Zhentian’s location and said: “In a regular bout of this level, an army will essentially be trivial. However, if they can utilize them correctly, this might no longer be the case. Each legion allows for one to have a majestic blood energy, a life force beyond imagination.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at the group before looking at Zhentian and chuckled: “To tell you the truth, I feel bad for your disciple. These old men have been here the whole time, but they chose to not do anything due to being afraid of alerting me. This ended with the death of your disciple. And maybe, you are aware of this as well. Your disciple’s sacrifice is still within an acceptable margin in your mind.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian’s expression changed completely as his eyes narrowed. In fact, he knew full well that the prince’s group was here the whole time. In his mind, leading Li Qiye here was their final plan. This trap wasn’t only meant for Li Qiye but also for the Lunargrasp Fairy and the True Martial Goddess.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless there was no other way, they wouldn’t go this far. It would be best if Zhentian could have killed Li Qiye by himself. If Li Qiye were to win or the women come to help him, they would lead them here into this trap and deliver a fatal blow!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince’s group had been hiding the whole time. They wouldn’t take action unless Zhentian couldn’t escape and until Li Qiye’s group made it into the trap.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye poured more salt over Zhentian’s wound. They indeed chose to sacrifice the general. This wasn’t a simple disciple for him. All along, he showed absolute loyalty and had many meritorious achievements. He also adored the general and taught him everything. To a certain extent, he even viewed him as his son.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But today, the general died for his sake. From a different perspective, this sacrifice was worth it, but it was still his beloved disciple!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian took a deep breath to calm down. With a cold glare, he uttered: “I’ll have revenge for my disciple!”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t say so when Cao Guoyao died, but he had made up his mind to avenge the general!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so?” Li Qiye smiled and told them: “I actually don’t see how you all can avenge him.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian’s expression turned ugly after hearing this. In the past, who would dare to show such disdain? People respected him everywhere. Even those stronger than him would treat him cordially. However, Li Qiye let him feel the taste of being looked down upon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, stop running your mouth.” The Terra King shouted: “Today will be your burial and here lies your tomb. Even if you have three heads and six hands or the ultimate power, you will still die!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With an icy glare, the king spoke with great confidence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so?” Li Qiye gave him a dismissive glance and replied: “You are still only a puppet. Either come out with your real body or I’ll wring your neck when I’m done with this formation.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long ago, the Lunargrasp Fairy also looked down at him like this. Now, Li Qiye has done the same. This drove the king mad as he laughed maniacally: “Good, good, Junior, I’ll let you see my true body then!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” His body began to transform into wood as branches protruded out. Shortly after, leaves and an old face emerged.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He coldly declared: “Junior, I’m not leaving until I kill you!” Not only did his appearance change, so did his voice. It became quite decrepit; the Terra King was no longer the same.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old treant ancestor respectfully said: “The vice ancestor is here.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people were shaken after seeing this. The Dragon Bamboo Vice Ancestor took root within the earth so he shouldn’t be able to leave the Ancestral Terra.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he created a new method. He latched onto a disciple with a similar bloodline, allowing him to leave the terra.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the Terra King had his own soul, consciousness, and ideas, he was still only a puppet. One of his three souls was left with the vice ancestor. Because of this, it was simple for the ancestor to take control of his body. He couldn’t refuse for he lacked the ability to do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are far from enough.” Li Qiye sneered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” The vice ancestor was furious, but the prince stopped him and said: “Vice Ancestor, keep the plan in mind.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestor glared at Li Qiye and snorted with great bloodthirst.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among them, the calmest was the Prince of Darkness. He stared at Li Qiye and said: “No one can deny your power, Li Qiye. It is worthy of pride, but it doesn’t mean that you are invincible.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye leisurely countered: “Is that so? I’ve always thought I’m invincible in the nine worlds.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It cannot be denied that you are indeed invincible once you become emperor.” The prince slowly answered: “However, you must understand that the people here aren’t the strongest in Heaven Spirit. We might be formidable, but there are beings stronger than us still. Even if you were to escape today, you won’t be able to evade all the ambushes from the real paragons!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words were quite insipid, yet people palpitated after hearing them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are even more powerful characters?” An unaware person thought that this group was already the strongest in Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” The old monarch turned serious in response: “There are still Emperor Assailants in Heaven Spirit, real assailants!”</span></p>
