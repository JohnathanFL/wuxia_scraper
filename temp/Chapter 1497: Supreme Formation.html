Everyone felt the earth tremble as well as its rhythm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within this short period of time, the entire formation seemed to be moving the ground itself and fusing to be one with the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” It didn’t take long before the power of the world melted into this formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if Zhentian and his legions have opened a floodgate. The power of the grand momentum endlessly poured into the formation with continuous blasts. The entire world was now enveloped by the momentum. It was originally protecting the Reincarnation Nine-Leaves, but it has been borrowed by Zhentian’s group.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at it from another perspective, if the power of the grand momentum was as vast as an ocean, then Zhentian’s formation was a port connecting this ocean’s power to their own formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it couldn’t borrow the power in its entirety as it was only a tiny portion, this minuscule amount in combination with the refined jades and the vitality from the troops culminated an unimaginable might.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!” Four Immortal Emperor weapons appeared among the four legions and poured down endless imperial laws. These laws then quickly integrated into the formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made the already-terrifying formation even more devastating. To the astonishment of the crowd, an array of this unprecedented level has been formed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What formation is this?” Even God-Monarchs trembled in fear. If any of them were to take a single step in this formation, they would be ground to dust without being able to resist in the slightest.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gently batted his eyes while standing inside the formation with a faint smile on his face.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, you are very strong indeed, but we aren’t weak either.” The prince was emboldened as the formation took shape and exclaimed: “Even an Emperor Assailant might not be able to escape from our grand formation!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This formation wasn’t meant for Li Qiye alone. Its purpose was to deal with terrifying beings like the Lunargrasp Fairy and the True Martial Goddess. However, the two of them didn’t come, so they had to use this formation on Li Qiye instead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do agree that this is powerful indeed.” Li Qiye perused the formation and chuckled: “Your efforts have indeed yielded some fruit. After so long, your abyss has figured out some secrets and are able to borrow some power from the momentum.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you know your stuff.” The prince spoke with a tinge of complacency. Keep in mind that even an Immortal Emperor might not be able to directly break through this grand momentum.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, their abyss was able to unravel some secrets. It wasn’t just the prince’s achievement alone. Many generations of their wise sages researched the Divine Tree Ridge before culminating in this feat carried out by the prince today.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A grand formation such as this isn’t something your Spirit Abyss can come up with.” Li Qiye revealed a carefree smile: “This is an array that imitates an Immortal Emperor’s Heaven’s Will. Not many people are qualified to do so. At the very least, your abyss can’t accomplish this, so it must be the achievement of the treefathers from the Ancestral Terra.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, Li, I guess you do know a lot.” Even the vice ancestor felt some glee despite hating Li Qiye. This was indeed their Ancestral Terra’s proudest work. It was just that they never had the chance to use it in the past.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, they wouldn’t use it frivolously due to the exorbitant price of opening such a supreme formation. Just the amount of refined jades was already too much for an ordinary lineage to bear.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be so smug.” Li Qiye casually countered: “Your legions are inferior to imperial legions. Plus, they haven’t undergone long-term training, it’s only a temporarily gathering. Not to mention the fact that you do not have the will of an emperor, you are forced to borrow the imperial weapons as substitutes. At the same time, there is no Heaven’s Will either, so a large amount of refined jades and vitality is necessary to support it. These factors limit this formation to ten to twenty percent of the true array at best. This is what people mean when they say, ‘trying to paint a tiger but end up with a dog instead’!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the chagrin of his foes, Li Qiye took his time explaining why their great formation was worthless. The vice ancestor’s countenance turned ugly since their masterpiece was being viewed with such disdain.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice ancestor declared: “Li, even if it can only exert ten to twenty percent of an emperor’s Heaven’s Will formation, it is more than enough to slaughter you!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is a Heaven’s Will formation?” Many experts have never heard of such a thing before.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old monarch mused before answering: “I have never seen it before either. Rumor has it that emperors have no need to use it because they, alone, are already invincible.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, there are tales about emperors creating these Heaven’s Will formations too. In theory, they are formed by an imperial legion. If the emperor can’t personally preside over the formation, they would let their Heaven’s Will do so. Therefore, such a formation doesn’t only have the power of the legion itself, it also contains the Heaven’s Will — extremely terrifying.” He elaborated his response with uncertainty.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An expert repeated: “Such a formation has appeared before?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old monarch had no answer to this because he has never seen it in action. Logically speaking, there was no need for an invincible being to use this type of formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In actuality, these Heaven’s Will formations have been used quite often in many famous battles since the start of time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, during the offense to kill Immortal Emperor Long Ming, the Dark Crow and countless wise sages surrounded him. The experts of myriad races in the nine worlds completely blocked off the Ancient Ming Race’s paths of escape. At that point, the emperor had no choice but to use his Heaven’s Will formation in order to stop the onslaught.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, he still failed in the end, resulting in his death and the destruction of the formation. His race was completely massacred!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Prince of Darkness coldly uttered: “Li Qiye, it is a fool’s dream to think about breaking through this siege today.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so?” Li Qiye was still as carefree as ever.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, we do not have to fight to the death.” The prince said: “If you agree, your future will still be as bright as before, and you may even become emperor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled and replied: “Am I hearing things? Are you saying that you want peace?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, many spectators couldn’t make sense of this either. The two sides should be fighting to the death, yet the prince wanted a ceasefire?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, if you agree, we can forget everything.” The prince said: “Even in the future when you compete against Brother Meng, all sects in Heaven Spirit will be impartial. The stronger of the two will win the chance to compete. Moreover, they will also gain the full support of Heaven Spirit.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People shuddered after hearing this. This was too tempting of a condition. Li Qiye had the absolute advantage while Zhentian was definitely not his match. If he could also have the full support of Heaven Spirit, it meant that he would have the resources and power to challenge the rest of the nine worlds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This temptation was virtually irresistible for anyone who wanted to become emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this brief moment, everyone quietly glanced at Li Qiye, eagerly waiting for him to make his decision.</span></p>
