An oath feud with the Spirit Abyss was no joke since this was a sect that would stay true to their word. One shouldn’t even dream about leaving Godhalt alive after receiving this declaration.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so? Good, I got it. If there is nothing else, scram. Of course, come if you want to fight. I have other stuff to do after I kill you all.” Li Qiye spoke in a carefree manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People helplessly smiled after hearing this. At this minute, it looked like Li Qiye viewed the abyss’ group as nobodies. It was as if he could kill them on a whim.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no one dared to question him. They understood that his strength was not simply boasting, he actually had the ability to do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just Yuxuan, all of the disciples from the abyss glared at Li Qiye with fury in their eyes due to this blatant humiliation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of them couldn’t help but scream: “First Brother, our abyss must kill him at all costs!” This wasn’t something their sect could let go.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another loudly chimed in: “Yes, First Brother, we swear to fight to the death, this is an irreconcilable blood feud!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were normally the imperious ones. Since when was it someone else’s turn to shit and piss over their heads like this?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuxuan took a deep breath as his eyes flashed a cold glint: “Li Qiye, I know you are very powerful, but if you still refuse to apologize, it will be a fight until one of us dies! Our abyss will not let this go.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gave him the side-eye and replied: “With just your group? Come together, it won’t be ‘until one of us dies’, all of you will be dead for sure. It’s about time to die.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such disdain left all the disciples here furious. They shouted: “First Brother, let’s kill him!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the abyss took this lying down, they wouldn’t need to show their face anymore. No one at Godhalt would put them in their sight again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuxuan shouted: “Fine! Li, today, we would like to see your amazing techniques!” He held a spear in his hands.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too late for deliberation. The abyss would not swallow this anger.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, I don’t have a method to show them without killing all of you. I’m giving all of you one last change, get going or I’ll massacre you all!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People could feel a cold tingle travel down their spines after hearing this. They had no choice but to take a deep breath. All of them could smell the stench of blood in the air.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fierce’s battle record was too bloody. He massacred a billion Teeming Fish, destroyed Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village, and finally the Regal Valley.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever Fierce declared his killing intent, everyone understood that he wasn’t messing around, he would actually kill everyone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuxuan was trembling with rage after being viewed as an ant by Li Qiye. Their valley should be the ones with this mentality, not him! This was beyond humiliating.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, Li Qiye, you’re strong enough! Today, our disciples will not stop until one of us dies!” Yuxuan screamed: “Our abyss and you shall not share the same sky!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, to the death!” The disciples cried out in unison: “We will use our blood to maintain the divine prestige of the Spirit Abyss!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disciples had no choice but to fight. If they were to show fear, those from their sect would never be able to raise their heads in front of Li Qiye again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commendable courage.” Li Qiye smiled: “I’m very moved by such hot-bloodedness. Unfortunately, it is unwise to oppose me. However, since all of you wish to die, I shall help you. Come together, I will give you a chance to attack so that you won’t die completely indignant deaths.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuxuan commanded: “Activate the formation!” He didn’t need to waste words any longer since the abyss and Li Qiye has completely broken all pretenses. There was no more leeway, it would be a fight to the death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With him as the lead, they formed a great formation with a murderous intent that soared to the sky. This chilling aura spread throughout the world with a sanguine touch.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many held their breaths while observing this scene. Someone quietly whispered with a lack of confidence: “Does Huang Yuxuan’s group have any chance at all?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid not. Fierce is too monstrous. The wisest thing to do when you meet someone like him is to run instead of opposing him unless death is on your mind.” An expert who had seen Li Qiye in action before shook his head: “Alas, the abyss cannot let this go so Yuxuan can’t escape death. They can’t be blamed either due to their position as rulers of Godhalt.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A paragon who knew that Li Qiye had slaughtered God-Monarchs before emotionally commented: “If Li Qiye can be suppressed, Yuxuan will at least have a chance to escape. Otherwise, there’s not much else that can happen.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” The group activated their divine reflections. It shone brightly and appeared like a great tree blotting out the sun.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Roar!” A gigantic divine beast rushed out from this mirror. A beastly aura engulfed the world with its coming.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing the beast, someone exclaimed in horror: “A Pixiu!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The divine reflection of the Spirit Abyss... Remember, the Dream Empyrean are the ones who can exert these reflections to their highest potential. They can even derive a divine beast out of it. Such an accomplishment is indeed amazing.” A sea demon spoke with a tinge of envy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A divine reflection was unique to charming spirits; they granted them a great advantage over the other races. The reason why they produced so many grand completion Immortal Physique users and physique laws was also due to their divine reflections.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Heaven Spirit, the abyss and the empyrean were considered to be the most gifted lineages at using their reflections. Some even believed that they were able to use these reflections to their maximum potential.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” One Pixiu stepped out after another to form the formation. The rest of the disciples disappeared, leaving behind only gigantic beasts to face Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Huang Yuxuan’s Pixiu Formation. It relied on their reflections to turn into Pixiu laws. They would utilize the power of these legendary divine beasts to kill their enemies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These monsters exuded a terrifying aura, especially the one from Huang Yuxuan. It was even bigger with a body of a mountain. One stomp from it could render any enemy into a pulp!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pixiu Formation, quite an illustrious one.” An expert commented: “I heard Huang Yuxuan used this formation to trap the Extreme Yang Monarch back then. The monarch couldn’t break out even after spending three days. It’s a pity that this group has met the wrong person. There’s no way that this formation can trap him!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Roar!” All the Pixius in the formation roared at the same time. Their cries echoed across the world. Just this was enough to scare all of their enemies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” Next, the earth quaked with loud blasts as the beasts advanced. Their sheer numbers and size made everything else seem insignificant. Even the most powerful cultivator would be torn to pieces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, ordinary paragons would be aghast when faced with this type of formation. It could even contend against God-Monarchs.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye simply smiled and slowly reached out with his right hand in the face of the incoming horde of Pixius.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” His right fist spontaneously combusted. With a series of explosions, it started to tremble as if he couldn’t control his own fist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” In a split second, this fist was burned to the limit and exploded. This explosion was very powerful like a sun that used up all of its refined sunfire. All of the power within erupted&nbsp;right away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a violent explosion had unimaginable power. A terrifying refined sunfire rushed out like a towering flood towards the Pixiu Formation. This fiery storm immediately drowned the beasts, causing them to disappear in a flash.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh, whoosh!” The solar storm eventually returned to his right hand alongside all of its power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, everything was annihilated, not even ashes were left behind. Huang Yuxuan and several hundred disciples from the abyss disappeared completely.</span></p>
