In their eyes, even if the nine worlds were to be connected again, Zhentian would still have a great chance of winning. After all, he had experience in the battle for the Heaven’s Will. Moreover, his strength was virtually flawless. Some were certain that no one else would become emperor but him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Plus, at the final battle, the charming spirits in Heaven Spirit would all help Zhentian. Even the sea demons and treants would be on his side.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, after one full generation of accumulation, Zhentian had ample resources and connections in Heaven Spirit. If he were to call for it, many experts from the previous generation would be willing to follow. There wouldn’t be any shortage of God-Monarchs or even Godkings.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this Li Qiye came out of nowhere and resoundingly at that, killing both gods and devils standing in his way. In a short amount of time, his fame completely eclipsed Zhentian, especially after this convention. He became even more brilliant with the support of the Lunargrasp Fairy and the True Martial Goddess.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian was overshadowed while standing beneath Li Qiye’s radiance. Some charming spirits who were optimistic about him were quite stirred.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It looks like both the fairy and goddess are bullish about Li Qiye.” A charming spirit clan leader spoke: “With them as his dao protectors, it would be even more difficult to do anything to him in the future.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that before the appearance of the next emperor, many imperial lineages and great powers would place their bets. If they picked the right candidate, it would be another generation of prosperity. If they guessed wrong, it would bring about declination or even total collapse.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, these sects needed to speculate whether they should support a particular candidate or not. After all, these candidates required help before ascension.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If, say, they finally showed support after he became an Immortal Emperor, it would be completely futile to try and gain anything out of it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, after the convention of myriad races, the great powers in Heaven Spirit began to hesitate. They didn’t know whether to place their money on Li Qiye or Meng Zhentian unlike the past when Zhentian was the clear victor in the eyes of all the races.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, humans were too weak in Heaven Spirit. Everyone felt that Li Qiye’s chances were too small regardless of his great talents.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, everything was now different. Li Qiye was exceptional and ferocious. The tide was reversed since he had won some new and powerful support.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, a few lineages who were on Zhentian’s side started to waver.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not necessarily!” Some of Zhentian’s stout supporters still believed in Zhentian’s chances. A few charming spirit lords continued to support him and even tried to lobby the other great powers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye might have the fairy and the goddess as his backing, but remember, Heaven Spirit is a vast world. The three races are very powerful, and it’s not like the two women are the strongest. There are still existences at the Emperor Assailant level yet to come out. I have received some reliable news that more Emperor Assailants have agreed to come out and become Zhentian’s supporters…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His steadfast supporters continued to talk to the wavering powers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing about some more Emperor Assailants coming out, the hesitating sects palpitated. If Zhentian truly had such protectors, his chance would be greatly boosted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the same day, people also heard about the fairy and goddess leaving Godhalt and heaved a sigh of relief in response. This was a rare opportunity for the few who wanted to scheme against Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The True Martial Island was very mysterious and elusive. Some said that it could travel and appear anywhere in Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for why it wandered around so much, this remains an unanswered mystery. One particular hypothesis was that the island was on a divine turtle that carried it around. Another one stated that the reason why it had such mobility was that the sea god had refined the entire island into a moving ancestral ground…</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of the speculations from outsiders, not many have been able to see the island itself. Only extremely amazing characters were privileged enough to be invited to the island.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scenery was very charming on the island with great peaks, verdant thickets, and towering waterfalls. Auspicious beasts and birds were everywhere to be found, but they didn’t disturb its serenity and peace.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye and Tantai Ruonan sat by a precipice and enjoyed the breeze while playfully swinging their feet.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She leaned on his shoulder and looked down on the entire island. The two of them didn’t say anything and basked in the peaceful silence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye wistfully spoke: “Millions of years have gone by, but the mountains and rivers remain the same, unlike the fleeting inhabitants.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it would be amazing if Father was still here.” Ruonan gently sighed and added: “I couldn’t send him off back then.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He only wants you to leave and go far away. He didn’t want you to come back. Even though you couldn’t send him off, I’m sure he feels very happy to know how far you have come.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Dark Crow, Li Qiye naturally knew what True Martial was thinking. This was an unfathomable character since he was on the same level as Prime.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being a child of the sea demon race, True Martial understood their race’s mission. However, the love of parents trumps everything in this world, and True Martial was no exception.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t want to see his daughter having to face this mission. As a sea god, he naturally knew what his daughter would have to do after becoming one herself. Because of this, the price didn’t matter in his search to sever his daughter’s bloodline. This was why he paid an exorbitant amount for the Dark Crow to do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted his daughter to soar to the free sky and swim in the liberating ocean instead of being shackled in Heaven Spirit. Of course, Ruonan understood her father’s good intentions and actions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, a full circle came around since she still returned to Heaven Spirit, the thing her father didn’t want to see the most.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t for that mission or whatever but for the land itself. She truly loved it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know…” After a long time, she lamented and continued: “I still want to see him again in this lifetime.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye slowly answered: “It’s not impossible. Even though the world says that sea gods are dead and no longer in this world, many things are still alive and continue to exist. This is just like the ancient bloodline itself. After generations have died, it will continue to be passed down.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She quietly nodded and knew what Li Qiye was referring to. She eventually asked: “When the Heaven’s Will comes back, will you start your journey, Young Master?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t need the Heaven’s Will for something so simple.” He gently shook his head: “In this generation, there is no turning back. I have to move forward until my death or the start of the new epoch! It isn’t easy to win in the final battle.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you waiting for then?” She knew just how cruel the final battle will be. Despite knowing that Li Qiye could very well die in battle, she still wouldn’t try to stop him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This has never been her intention, and she didn’t want him to stop either for it would go against his courageous creed that has lasted for millions of years!

Otherwise, death will await me regardless of how powerful I am.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m certain you can wait until then.” Ruonan gently replied: “You have been plotting for generations so waiting a bit longer won’t cause any harm.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed, it shall come. Too many people have been buried and too many bones have been paved. Gods and emperors, how many of these invincible beings became nothing but bones in the end?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Maybe I’ll be around long enough and see your triumphant return.” She held his hand tightly and intertwined her fingers with his.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye declared with a smile: “When I am victorious, it will be a glorious and beautiful era.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their casual conversation would make others think of two lovers sweet-talking to each other.
