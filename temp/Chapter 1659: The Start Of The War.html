The leader was an old general with a divine armor. His saber was flashing with a bloody light. His bloodthirst simply wouldn’t dissipate. It was obvious at first glance that this was an experienced and fierce general.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t know your own limit, simply courting death!” The old general cried and led his troops to fight against the other army.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was domineering and unstoppable.

Not long after the start of the war, Hai Lin’s legion continuously faltered for it was not a match for Soaring Immortal. Despite their unyielding will to fight, their army was recruited in a short time. The soldiers came from everywhere with varying abilities and had no prior training.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” As the battle was heading for the end, the opposing legion was being massacred.
