<p><b>Chapter 443: Not Everyone Is A Storyteller</b></p><p>Everyone’s mouths were wide open. Such a mess of a story was able to be traded for a treasure? Simply too unbelievable. Qiurong Wanxue also found this hard to believe. Everyone else would think the same if they were told of this event.</p><p>“For you.” Li Qiye placed the jade coffin into Qiurong Wanxue’s hand. Only then did she become certain that this was not just a dream.</p><p>“This…” Qiurong Wanxue was sent into a daze. Li Qiye gave another precious treasure to her?</p><p>Li Qiye jokingly added: “Don’t misunderstand, this is not a token of affection.”</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue was very reserved but also touched. Although he made it a joke, Qiurong Wanxue still found the gesture to be warm and sweet.</p><p>“Okay, this auction consists of a total of nine coffins. This is the second one, a silver coffin.” Imp continued with a smile: “This is good stuff, especially for the ghost race. Nightsoul Aqua — ghost tribe cultivators who use this water would surely be able to strengthen their True Fate.”</p><p>Imp opened the silver coffin. Inside was a pale greenish water that exuded nether energy. The ghost race cultivators felt this atmosphere and noticed that their True Fate was becoming even more spirited.</p><p>It made them realize that this Nightsoul Aqua was an extremely beneficial and sacred water to the ghost race.</p><p>“I want to tell a story, I want to tell a story!” People began to compete for the chance to tell a story.</p><p>Li Qiye only smiled before he closed his eyes. The Nightsoul Aqua had no use to him.</p><p>Imp randomly pointed at a young cultivator and said: “Okay, you try.”</p><p>The youth chosen by Imp was ecstatic. He cleared his throat in preparation and began: “There was once a child who fell into an immortal grotto. There was an immortal grass growing inside this grotto…”</p><p>“Nonsense!” He only said a few words before he got flung out of Midtown by Imp.</p><p>“I have a story, I have one!” Others did not give up. They raised their hands and loudly shouted.</p><p>Imp then randomly picked another person. This person cheerfully began: “During the Desolate Era, a Golden Phoenix appeared in the Sacred Nether World. On its back was an immortal citadel…”</p><p>“Nonsense!” The youth’s story was quite wonderful, but he didn’t get too far before being thrown out of Midtown by Imp.</p><p>A dozen stories followed suit; some were very well told, but all of them were flung away regardless.</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue had a hard time containing her excitement while holding the jade coffin. She listened to all of the stories so far and found it very strange. Some of the tales were colorful. One was even comparable to Immortal Emperor legends, but all the storytellers were thrown out by Imp.</p><p>In fact, she was not the only one since many others were confused as well. Why was Imp so unreceptive towards these other tales?</p><p>“Young Noble, why was Imp interested in your story?” The perplexed Qiurong Wanxue whispered softly in Li Qiye’s ear.</p><p>Li Qiye looked at her and smilingly replied: “The crux of the matter is not the story itself but the information contained within. It has to be valuable and useful!”</p><p>“Useful and valuable information?” Qiurong Wanxue uttered in surprise. She didn’t feel that her Young Noble’s story contained any valuable information at all.</p><p>“This is not something you guys can understand.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “If one does not know the immemorial past and the Immortal Demon, then how could they know about the thing hidden in the tale?”</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue then recalled the story told by her Young Noble. If he said so, then this story must be hiding a big secret, but she didn’t feel anything too amazing about this particular story.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, you lack the necessary experience to understand.” Li Qiye said with a smile.</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue softly sighed and gave up on the matter. Just like Li Qiye had said, understanding the essence of the story was beyond her means.</p><p>After dozens of people were thrown out, the participants began to understand that storytelling wouldn’t do and so they started to take out items to trade.</p><p>Eventually, the second coffin was traded to a young cultivator from an ancient clan for an old calligraphy painting.</p><p>Many people found Imp’s preferences to be very strange. Other cultivators would consider merit laws as number one and treasure number two. Stuff like calligraphy paintings had no real use and was not worth a coin, but Imp just had to love these kinds of things.</p><p>Many young cultivators were full of regrets. If they knew that Imp liked these strange stuff, then they would have bought a bunch in the mortal world since these calligraphy paintings were not worth anything at all; they could buy as many as they wanted.</p><p>While others felt that the painting was worthless, Li Qiye opened his eyes and quietly praised: “A good item.”</p><p>“What is it?” Qiurong Wanxue also couldn’t see how this painting was useful. To ordinary people, this was art, but art was useless to cultivators. Cultivators simply aimed for power!</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and explained: “This is something from an ancient dynasty. The average person will not be able to see through its profoundness; it contains a few things worth desiring.”</p><p>Li Qiye didn’t reveal the entire secret, but Qiurong Wanxue now knew that this painting was not so simple. She wondered why Li Qiye knew so many things; it was as if he was privy to many secrets.</p><p>And as if he knew what she was thinking, he continued: “Because I read a lot. This is why I know so many things.”</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue gave him a glance full of doubt. If everything in this world was written down, then there would be no secrets.</p><p>Imp continued to auction off six more coffins, including a golden coffin and divine wood coffins with all kinds of things inside, such as treasures and strange items that no one knew about.</p><p>The items that he wanted were also very special. Items that belonged to the great powers were not to his liking. During the auction, Golden Child and the Divine Spark Prince took out treasures from their sects, but they were all declined.</p><p>People found that Imp liked items that were excavated from Necropolis. Including the jade coffin won by Li Qiye, Imp had auctioned off seven items. Amongst the six coffins, four successful trades included four items found in Necropolis.</p><p>The young cultivators then understood that Imp was looking for certain things in Necropolis, so they acted accordingly when presenting their possessions.</p><p>“The last two coffins are truly amazing. They’re very rare in this world.” After the seventh coffin was auctioned, Imp smiled and then kindly said: “As long as you obtain one of these two treasures, then on the day that you understand them, you will be free to do as you please with their usefulness.”</p><p>The young ones became very lively after hearing this. The previous seven coffins all contained incredible items, and now only two were left. It seemed that the last two were even better than the previous seven. He even said that they were very rare in this world, so they had to be extremely wondrous.</p><p>At this point, Imp slowly took out a bronze coffin. This bronze coffin was very large; it was twice the size of an ordinary coffin and it contained something huge inside.</p><p>Imp slightly tapped it and then narrowed his eyes before speaking with a grin: “Now, let me see your items. If I see something that I like, then this coffin will belong to you.”</p><p>“Why don’t you open the coffin so that everyone can take a look?” Someone couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>Imp cheerfully replied: “There is no rush, my item is definitely something good. Wait until I look at your offers first. I can open the coffin later.”</p><p>Having heard this, people quickly took out their items so that they wouldn’t lag behind.</p><p>“I have a Green Ivory Stone found inside the Penta Realm Gate.” A young cultivator took out his item and introduced it to Imp.</p><p>“I have a Profound River Lock. This was inside a Ghost Algae Trunk at the Ghost River.” People hurriedly took out their items.</p><p>Meanwhile, Imp was looking at the thing the Divine Spark Prince took out. The prince noticed that Imp was interested in his item so he energetically recommended: “I obtained this in Necropolis. When it was unearthed, a scintillating nether light shot everywhere. Although I don’t know what kind of treasure it is, it is definitely one-of-a-kind.”</p><p>“Kind of interesting.” Imp glanced at the prince’s item and nodded his head.</p><p>Golden Child took out a gray eye and said: “This is an ancient eye left behind by a wise sage from my tribe. Its origin is unclear, but it is surely wondrous.”</p><p>“Yes, that is indeed very rare.” Imp looked at the eye and nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
