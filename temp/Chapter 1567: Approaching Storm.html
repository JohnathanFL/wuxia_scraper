How could he accept this?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled in response: “A better talent isn’t everything. For many ages now, there have been many wonderful prodigies. Some even had immortal bones but so what? It’s not like you need to have peerless talents to have supreme achievements.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a bit: “The Black Dragon King’s achievements weren’t because of his talents, just his determined dao heart. After so much pain, he was able to create a new life after each generation. His tireless pursuit towards the grand dao is the thing most worthy of pride, not his talents.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man nodded but who knows if he actually understood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled and said: “Go now, the old men will return sooner or later.” With that, his body flashed and disappeared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man could only sigh and quietly prayed for the ancestors to return safely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye had left the village but not the island completely. He sat cross-legged on a shoal rock and watched the waves hitting it. This was a location not just anyone could enter.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the waves hitting the rock up and down and occasionally filling the cave beneath left him absent-minded. After a while, he withdrew his eyes and murmured: “Lil Blackie, don’t blame me for being merciless. The only thing I can do is to minimize the casualty when I slaughter the city. At the very least, I promise I won’t turn it to ashes. That’s the best I can do. It is your lifelong fruit but it’s not like I didn’t spend a lot of effort too. I was the one who laid the foundation when you created it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued on: “All along, you couldn’t bear to imprison Gu Zun forever and definitely not kill him. I know, you promised someone else to take good care of him. Unfortunately, the boy does not know the immensity of the heaven and earth. He had a bright future and could even become Immortal Emperor. It’s a shame that he’s too greedy!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back then, I threw him into the eye of the sea because you beseeched me to spare his life. But it’s different now. In order to spare the city, Gu Zun must die! It’s that simple. In this generation, whether you can come out or not, I’m telling you today that Gu Zun is finished regardless of your promise. You know that I have done enough by sparing him once.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was blabbering as if talking to himself. After some more time had passed, he smiled and said: “Blackie, your achievements are worthy of pride. It’s also a shame that you can’t surpass the particular blockade in your heart. Otherwise, your brilliant legend and shining figure would be up above the nine heavens as well! Live by this belief, die by this belief, perhaps.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the sound of the waves hitting the rock answered him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s time to end the issues at Heaven Suppression. I can’t guarantee you about other things, but after Gu Zun dies, someone even more suitable will take charge of it. Your inheritance will continue to have a long history from then on.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, Li Qiye stood up and instantly disappeared from the vast sea.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand Sea has been peaceful in recent years.

Long Aotian is a chinese meme, especially in yy webnovels. This is the defining name for the most dominating character. In fact, it would be quite hilarious if Li Qiye had this name. Mary Sue would be the English equivalence. Long = Dragon, Ao = Arrogant/Proud/Overbearing, Tian = Heaven. Ao becomes a verb here when combined with Tian or a location. Something along the line of walking proudly and fearlessly across the heavens. As you can see, it’s a pretty grand name. Almost as grand as Bao<a href="#footnote-ref-3635"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p></div><div id="footnote-02f1"><p>2. This is Kevin Durant joining the Warriors. Sssssssssss.
