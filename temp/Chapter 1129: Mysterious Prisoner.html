<p><b>Chapter 1129: Mysterious Prisoner</b></p><p>“Boom! Boom!” More explosions resounded. Cleansing Incense also used their own imperial weapons — the Violet Imperial Hammer and the Black Tortoise Rod!</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t easy to utilize the power of these weapons. Those from the older generation, like Gu Tieshou, were even more powerless in using them. In the end, Xu Pei’s group had to retreat to the main mountain of the sect and work together to use the two imperial weapons.</p><p>The Heavenly God Ancestor commanded: “Press the attack!” The other ancestors continued to use their imperial weapon to open a path straight to Cleansing Incense.</p><p>Xu Pei’s and Nan Huairen’s groups controlled one imperial weapon each. They used their imperial laws to protect the sect from the oncoming onslaught of the other weapon.</p><p>Even though the sect had the rod and hammer, they were still too young; there existed a big gap between them and the Heavenly God ancestors.</p><p>Nevertheless, they managed to hold their ground against the offensive for now, resulting in a stalemate.</p><p>“All of you, follow me.” The Heavenly God Ancestor didn’t care about this field. He brought along several hundred experts to go straight for the Heavenly Crow Peak.</p><p>His goal was very clear. He wanted the manuals from the sect, especially their Immortal Emperor laws! In his eyes, destroying Cleansing Incense was only a matter of time. Even if his sect couldn’t break through right away, his backing was still there.</p><p>Because of this, he needed to rush ahead and seize the merit laws first. His sect required these imperial laws the most. If they had some, then perhaps one day, they would be able to compare to imperial lineages.</p><p>“Kill!” The disciples guarding the Heavenly Crow Peak screamed and went to face the intruders.</p><p>In their eyes, the Heavenly Crow Peak was the heart of Cleansing Incense. Their treasures and merit laws were all located here. If the enemies could take down this place, then Cleansing Incense would lose for sure.</p><p>“Scram!” There was no need for the Heavenly God Ancestor to take action. The several hundred experts rushed forward to kill the Cleansing Incense disciples.</p><p>“Ah—” Shrill screams resounded. The Heavenly God Sect came prepared as they had rushed to rob these merit laws. These experts were all carefully chosen; they were experts among experts.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, these experts killed all the disciples guarding the Heavenly Crow Peak. They easily entered the peak and headed for the triangular square.</p><p>“Clang—Clang—Clank—” While these experts were rushing in, a man that was chained to a shrine stood up.</p><p>“Clank!” The man tore off his chains.</p><p>More metallic clanks echoed from the chains. This man immediately took action. The two chains on his wrists resembled flood dragons leaving the water as they went straight for the experts.</p><p>“Ah—” Now it was their turn to scream. The two iron chains pierced all several hundred of them like meat skewers.</p><p>The disparity in power was too great. Despite their great numbers, they were no match for this man.</p><p>“Who are you!” The Heavenly God Ancestor was startled. This happened too suddenly, so he couldn’t even react in time to save them.</p><p>“Clang—” The stout man didn’t say anything and swung his chains down with a ferocious and unstoppable momentum.</p><p>The aghast ancestor summoned his weapon and unleashed a supreme art to fight against this man.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>They took their fight to the sky. The unknown man used his chains as a weapon to stop the ancestor.</p><p>Even though the ancestor had been famous for quite a while and the world was scared of him, he couldn’t seize the upper hand against this man. On the contrary, he was completely suppressed.</p><p>Everyone was shocked to see this. Many experts in the distance murmured: “That’s an imperial lineage for you, crouching tigers and hidden dragons are everywhere.”</p><p>Even the disciples and elders from Cleansing Incense were astounded because, in their memory, the burly man had always been locked in that place. No one knew his identity or what his background was. Even the first elder, Gu Tieshou, didn’t know where he came from.</p><p>They didn’t expect that the chained man was so powerful.</p><p>“Boom!” The ancestor’s defensive treasure was struck by the iron chain. He vomited blood and fell down from the sky. He staggered back more than ten steps before he could stabilize his body.</p><p>His face was unsightly to the extreme. His illustrious fame was once notorious, but today, he was not a match for this unknown person. How could he not be furious?</p><p>He finally shouted: “Dao brothers, please lend me a hand to destroy Cleansing Incense!”</p><p>The more naive spectators were surprised by this. So it turned out that the Heavenly God Sect hadn't come alone, they still had some backings.</p><p>“Rumble!” The void suddenly opened at this time. A vast mountain emerged before everyone. It pierced straight into the sky. Waterfalls fell down for a thousand miles with divine eagles circling about. This was the dwelling of green flood dragons…</p><p>This majestic landscape suddenly appearing in the sky stunned everyone. They thought that a secret realm had shown itself to the world.</p><p>A Virtuous Paragon from the previous generation shouted: “Space Trample Mountain!”</p><p>Someone blurted in horror: “Space Trample Mountain! It’s finally here.”</p><p>This was a lineage created by Immortal Emperor Ta Kong. Despite only having one emperor, many people believed that it was comparable to a sect with three emperors because many of his generals were still alive and guarding the mountain.</p><p>“Rumble!” While people were still gazing at the scene in the sky, a cavalry soared out from this flying mountain and entered the aerial space of Cleansing Incense.</p><p>This cavalry did not boast large numbers — only a few hundred. However, it gave off the aura of a bloodthirsty primordial monster.</p><p>Even before it joined the fray, one could already smell a bloody stench, as if its appearance signaled the start of a massacre.</p><p>Leading this cavalry was an old man in black with a spear hanging on his back. His dangerous aura caused others to shudder uncontrollably.</p><p>“Era Sentinel General!” In the horizon, an ancestor from a great power recognized this old man and blurted in shock: “A general directly under Immortal Emperor Ta Kong!”</p><p>After hearing this, those who had heard of his name were frightened. This was a ferocious general under the emperor. Later on, he patrolled the Mortal Emperor World for the emperor. People were quite scared of him.</p><p>“A centipede dies but never falls!” Era Sentinel coldly glared at the burly man with an oppressive murderous intent: “But today, no matter what power Cleansing Incense still has hidden, it won’t be able to escape demise. Your disciples should never have offended those whom they couldn't afford to offend!”</p><p>The crowd was astonished to see Era Sentinel personally leading a cavalry into this battle. Even the disciples of Cleansing Incense knew that they were in dire straits.</p><p>The burly man turned serious as well. He knew that he had met a formidable foe!</p><p>“Xue Hongyi, you shouldn’t have come here.” A voice rang at this time: “Back when your Space Trample Mountain schemed in the background and ordered the Heavenly God Sect to invade Cleansing Incense’s territory, these old bones didn’t want to bother with you. But now, your mountain actually comes to bully my Cleansing Incense, do you think we have no one to stand up for ourselves?”</p><p>A person emerged above the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. No one knew when or how he got there.</p><p>It was an old man that didn’t resemble an expert at all. His wretched and lowly appearance was especially striking when he opened his mouth, revealing three yellow teeth. He simply lacked the style and bearing of an expert.</p><p>“Old Devil!” Everyone from Cleansing Incense was stunned at the sight of him. Even Gu Tieshou couldn’t believe his eyes. [1. Formerly known as San (Three) Gui (Sly/pervert/ghost) Ye (Grandpa/old person). Couldn’t come up with a good title back then that included all three words, so I left it in pinyin. His nickname has the number three because he is good at three things: spending money, lying, and fooling around in brothels. It’s harder to implement three than third and it makes the nickname even longer. Old Devil Three, Eccentric Three, Pervert Three, Old Three; blah.]</p><p>This person that came out of thin air was a celebrity at Cleansing Incense — Old Devil. He was a wretched old man that spent all day with women down at the Happy Crimson Pavilion! [2. The name of the brothel.]</p><p>Even new disciples didn’t care for Old Devil because everyone knew that he was only a lecherous grandpa.</p><p>Who would have thought that when Cleansing Incense was on the verge of demise, this perverted and wretched old man would come out to face Era Sentinel?</p><p>Era Sentinel’s eyes lit up with a terrifying light after seeing this old man as if he wanted to see through him.</p><p>“Mu Shaodi, is that you? You are the handsome and matchless Mu Shaodi?” He spoke the name without any certainty.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
