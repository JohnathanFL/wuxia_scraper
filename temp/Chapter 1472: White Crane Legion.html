Even All-Martial, who had been accompanying the goddess, was very interested. He wanted to know Li Qiye’s identity. Who the heck could Li Qiye be to be so adored by the daughter of his sea god?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the two alone, Li Qiye felt warm while looking at her. He hadn’t felt this for a long time, it was as if he was meeting family again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Welcome back, Ruonan.” He smiled and opened his arms.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The goddess smiled back, filled with happiness.

The Maelstrom, the Divine Tree Ridge, and even the Bonesea are moving, so I was jolted during my slumber. I didn’t expect to see you, Young Master, come out.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, the world is changing.

He didn’t wish for his daughter to walk on the same path as him in the future and wanted nothing more than for her to be free of the sea demon bloodline, to be able to travel across the nine heavens without restraint.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, her divine bloodline was extremely powerful.

This was the era when Immortal Emperor Min Ren was in charge of the nine worlds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, the sea god went to meet the imperial teacher, the Dark Crow, in order to search for a method of severing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They made ample preparations and worked together with Immortal Emperor Min Ren to blind the heaven’s eyes and removed all related karmic fate. Finally, with the help of the sea god and emperor, they managed to sever her bloodline and disconnected her from the sea demon race.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, Ruonan seemingly disappeared from the world overnight as if she had evaporated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She gently spoke after a long silence: “This is still my birthplace, the land I grew up. Even though I have severed my karmic connection with the sea demon race, I still hope to stay until the disaster so that I can contribute.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, many people love this Heaven Spirit World. It is an amazing land that gives birth to many talents. However, it will eventually face a terrible disaster. Nevertheless, this hasn’t deterred people and wise sages from working hard to stop it.” Li Qiye spoke with a tinge of emotion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruonan quietly spoke: “I’m glad that you aren’t forcing me, Young Master.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In fact, I don’t want to leave you at all even if you aren’t an Immortal Emperor.

Those who knew about the tales of the Dark Crow, the hand behind the curtains, have more or less heard about these legions. Some eternal existences were certain of their presence as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the fourth legion had more speculations about it than the others.

Some ancient existences believed it could have been the Vermillion Legion, Black Dragon Legion, or an imperial legion.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the other three legions themselves didn’t know much about the fourth. Only the truly loyal confidants of the Dark Crow were privy to this information.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The missing line was — the White Crane, most secretive!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This elusive legion had always been hidden and nameless like hermits even on the first day of its inception. <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't the Vermillion Legion with many illustrious battle record and not the Black Dragon Legion that has deterred three generations. It wasn’t started by an Immortal Emperor either.&nbsp;</span> Nevertheless, people still somehow knew about the four legions of the Dark Crow due to the popular saying.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was secretly founded by Li Qiye during Immortal Emperor Min Ren’s generation.

However, his resources and strength were lacking, so he couldn’t carry out such a grandiose idea. It wasn’t until he was in charge and Immortal Emperor Min Ren started the Emperors Era did he have the means to carry out this magnificent plan.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This gave birth to the White Crane Legion.

The same goes for you, Young Master. You have been protecting the nine worlds all along. There are always places that you can’t forget, that you keep yearning for. That’s why even though you have entered the upper world, you still returned to the nine worlds in the end and continued to train more Immortal Emperors.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not as great as you say.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “I didn’t return to protect the nine worlds.
