<p>The disciples also didn't like his attitude during the two days that he had been here. Of course, this was understandable since he did threaten to destroy the Nine Saint Demon Gate. The fire and hatred in their eyes could kill Li Qiye a hundred times over.</p><p>They started to converse amongst themselves: “Let us kill him as well as the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.”</p><p>“No, we have to cut off his arms and feet then use his head as a candle holder.”</p><p>“A candle holder? That is too humane. This ant wants to marry our princess? We have to imprison him on top of Hawk Cliff. Let the hawks peck at him for a hundred years while we keep him alive with medicinal techniques.”</p><p>The conversations quickly turned rowdy; the crowd fueled itself with their anger and hatred for Li Qiye. Both Protector Mo and Nan Huairen were shaking in fear. Their teeth couldn’t stop clattering.</p><p>Li Qiye removed himself from the surroundings. He calmly walked around the pavilion with an arrogant flair. Anyone would have fainted from being surrounded by so many people that want to eat them alive.</p><p>“Hmm…” At this moment, Grand Protector Yu He coughed. This seemingly quiet cough overpowered the crowd. No matter how loud the surroundings were, everyone heard it and immediately stopped talking. The aura of a Royal Noble once again dominated the air.</p><p>At this time, Protector Hua began to talk: “If you can successfully complete the trial, then our two sects will become in-laws in accordance to the ancient tradition. If you can’t pass or if you die during the test, then it is a shame that you are not skillful enough.”</p><p>Li Qiye sat down on a chair and turned towards Protector Hua. He slowly shook his head and smiled: “One can only say the Nine Saint Demon Gate is not as eminent as it once was. In that era, why did the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon make that promise? Why did the two sects become in-laws and allies? Back then, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was worshipped by the heavens and ruled the Nine Worlds. Simply put, the Nine Saint Demon Gate only wanted the protection of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, to have a backing in order to grow.”</p><p>Li Qiye did not know all of the stories of the past because his condition was not fully stable at that time. The marriage between the two was not proposed by Immortal Emperor Ming Ren and the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon, it was proposed by their descendants.</p><p>Li Qiye continued: “Now, the era has changed and you want to relinquish the promise after having benefitted from it. Your current generation is incomparable to your ancestors.”</p><p>Protector Hua interjected: “Hmmph, it is as you have said, eras change. If you want to say that the current generation is worse than the past, then this statement applies to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, not us. We currently rule the country. The Emperor lineages who want to become our in-laws number more than just one or two, yet you think someone like you is worthy of our princess?”</p><p>Grand Protector Yu He started to speak: “Just let the past go, you can’t change anything by quarreling.”</p><p>“We are giving you a chance to honor the promise of past. If you are afraid, then you can leave now. We will not stop or bother you, and the promise of that year will end.”</p><p>“Since I am already here, I might as well accept the challenge. What is the trial?” Li Qiye preferred Yu He’s attitude a lot more.</p><p>“Since your cultivation is not ideal, Our Highness has decided to give you a better chance. The first test will not be combat oriented, but the second will be.”</p><p>Yu He continued after a short pause: “The first test is very simple. You will have to go into the Chaotic Heart Forest with one of our disciples; the one that travels the furthest wins. The second test is even simpler; it will be a solo fight to determine the victor. There is also a third test, but you only need to pass two tests to pass the trial. The third test consists of—”</p><p>Li Qiye cut off the protector: “There's no need to continue, two tests will suffice.”</p><p>“How arrogant!” Protector Hua yelled at him for being too arrogant. He started to exert his pressure towards Li Qiye: “The test hasn’t even started yet you want to fight already?”</p><p>Li Qiye narrowed his eyes. He found great joy in aggravating people he did not like.</p><p>Grand Protector Yu He coughed once again. This cough severed the pressure that Protector Hua was exerting, angering Protector Hua. He could kill Li Qiye by simply lifting his finger. There has never been an insect that dared to talk to him like this before.</p><p>“Alright, let us being the tests." Li Qiye rose from his seat: “Both tests are fine, I want to see the abilities of your princess.”</p><p>Xu Hui contemptuously laughed: “You don’t have the qualifications for Senior Li to participate in person. I will be the one that you will go up against.”</p><p>Yu He nodded in agreement: “I heard that you have only recently joined the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. We will not cheat you. If the princess personally delivers the test, you would have no chance at all. Here, when it comes to inner talents and potential, the princess is number one. When it comes to battle capabilities, Junior Leng is the best. If one of them comes to test you, you would claim that it was unfair after failing. Junior Xu Hui has average talents among our inner disciples, so using him to test the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect should not be too demeaning to your status.”</p><p>By not sending out their best disciples, the Nine Saint Demon Gate was giving Li Qiye a sliver of hope. If the strongest disciple or Li Shuangyan participated, then even the six elders would have problems.</p><p>Li Qiye didn’t bother to look at Xu Hui. He stared at Yu He and formally said: “If this is the case, then at least your Nine Saint Demon Gate still has some hope. Although you went back on the original promise, you still managed to save a little bit of face and dignity. Fine, since you are allowing me to walk an extra step, I will spare you a yard just so that in the future, you can’t say that I have bullied the sect.”</p><p>A character like Yu He had spent many years experiencing everything life had to offer, but when he looked at Li Qiye, it still puzzled him how there could be someone who was this arrogant and confusing. Does he not know of our strength? Does he have zero concept of cultivation levels? Yu He broke his stoic demeanor with a small chuckle: “Go to the Chaotic Heart Forest. The one that can walk the farthest will win.”</p><p>Seeing that the test had finally begun, people started going towards the Chaotic Heart Forest. In a split second, the forest was instantly surrounded.</p>
