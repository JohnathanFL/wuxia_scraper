If I was still the Dark Crow, it would be my time to take care of everything and harvest. Afterward, it would be a fruitful and brilliant age. Unfortunately, it’s time for me to leave…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master, whether it be your lovers or fallen brothers or even me, you don’t need to stay for anyone.” Ruonan replied in a serious manner: “Just keep walking forward to fight the last battle. No one can stop your advance; this is your greatest charm and why people admire you. If, say, you were to stop because of me, I would be a sinner in your life. In my eyes, you are the one I admire the most, so I don’t want to leave a stain in your life. That would be an unforgivable crime.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She spoke sincerely; each word came from the heart.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know.” Li Qiye nodded: “I won’t be stopping for you, that’s just how life is. Even if someone used to be the ruler of the nine heavens or master of the universe, they still can’t have everything go their way.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master, there’s no need to worry about me. I made my own choice so even if I die in battle one day, it will be without regrets since that would still be accomplishing one of my goals. In my life, to have met you and be able to follow you are my best moments and memories. You taught me how vast the world is, gave me a pursuit in life, and showed me the profundities of the grand dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How many people in the world are actually aware of this? Most lives are ephemeral. Without your guidance, I could still have become a blessed daughter of the heavens, an existence that could walk proudly across the nine worlds. However… I wouldn’t be me, someone who withstands the arduous passing of time. You gave me a firm dao heart — this is more precious than anything else!” Her eyes turned red at this point.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Silly girl.” He wiped away the tears and smiled: “You are definitely a blessed existence. Even without me, you could still make it to this level. Your success today isn’t necessarily because of me. You yourself are worthy of pride. If your father was here, he would be proud because of his daughter even if your choice conflicts with his wish.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruonan eventually smiled and gently shook her head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, I’m going to try again and see if there are more people without eyes.” He lifted his head and chuckled: “Another big wave might create some effect.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruonan knew what he wanted to do and smiled back.

Someone of his level isn’t qualified to know about this or I would have figured it out long ago.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While everyone was awestruck by Li Qiye’s battle record, the sky over at the Dragon Demon Sea seemed to have been torn open.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” A boundless light surged out and illuminated the entire region.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Waves of endless height were set off after a loud explosion. The entire Dragon Demon Sea quaked. All of the existences there were trembling with fear.

It was the size of a continent. The moment it entered this region, it set off the terrifying waves that impacted everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing this, an expert exclaimed: “The Roaring Conch!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many fresh cultivators had never seen this scene before and were completely stunned.

The people of that era believed that if Immortal Emperor Hao Hai didn’t exist, Fengyun would have become emperor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The juniors from the four branches took a deep breath.

I’m not sure what the author meant here so I went with a complete literal translation of pure sun (Yang). The word itself is the name of a county; the classical/poetical meaning of the word is spring.
