His bright eyes made everyone feel a sense of dread.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An Emperor Assailant!” The old monarch was stunned to see the pair of world-destroying eyes. After regaining his wits, fear overwhelmed him as he almost kneeled on the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone else in this place was frightened as well. This old man ahead was very ordinary in both appearance and aura compared to Zhentian’s group, who had incredible visual phenomena accompanying them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A real one!” The wise characters from the previous generation were aghast and took several thumping steps back, not daring to look into his eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majority of cultivators here lowered their heads, averting their gazes from his own. His gaze was too horrifying and all-destroying. Anyone who looked at his eyes for a long time would find their soul depart the body and instantly die.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor Assailant — an existence that deters the very soul. Everyone turned timid with a tingling sensation on their scalp.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An Emperor Assailant has finally shown up.” Someone murmured while stealing glances at the old man.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a terrifying existence worthy of admiration. Characters of this level wouldn’t easily come into being. The appearance of every single one was always a big deal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no doubt that he was here for the medicine of immortality in Li Qiye’s possession.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shortly after, the crowd was excited again to see how Li Qiye would act towards this Emperor Assailant.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s fixated gaze on Li Qiye seemed to have taken physical form. Anyone would feel trepidation while being stared at by this powerful existence. Some would even directly fall to the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Li Qiye was completely fine. He leisurely glanced at the old man and said: “And here I thought it was someone else. So it’s you, old Imperial Dualchild.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was a bit surprised to be recognized: “I have lived in seclusion for a long time. I can’t believe someone actually remembers me.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old experts haven’t heard of this top character. Nevertheless, no one showed any signs of slight before him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-8169"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Imperial Dualchild...” A big shot sealed for many eras gasped after hearing this: “Rumor has it that he is the son of an Immortal Emperor and a treemother! He, he is still in this world.” </span></span><a href="#footnote-8169">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The insightful crowd collectively recalled an old legend after hearing this. According to the stories, an emperor had gotten together with a treemother and gave birth to a child.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the two didn’t formally marry each other, this old man was indeed their son. Because of this, others called him the Imperial Dualchild.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even throughout the entire nine worlds, this fella was famous in that generation. However, after that generation passed, he disappeared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After so many years, people didn’t expect him to still be alive. Nevertheless, they weren’t surprised to see him in this place. A character like him must have lived for a long time and sealed for many eras. Despite being the child of two great existences, he still couldn’t bear the torture of time and needed the immortal medicine to prolong his life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dualchild stared at Li Qiye and slowly asked: “Young Friend, how about we make a deal?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled in response: “You want the item in my possession?” He naturally knew what Dualchild wanted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Dualchild nodded: “You know your stuff, so you can understand that the Reincarnation Nine-Leaves aren’t that useful to you since you are still young. If you trade it to me, just tell me whatever wishes you have.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was slightly moved after hearing this. The words of an Emperor Assailant were very tempting. A successful trade with one would grant a lifetime of benefits.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What can you give me?” Li Qiye chuckled: “I know you are the descendant of an Immortal Emperor and a treemother so you have many treasures. However, I’m not interested at all in imperial weapons or the secret techniques of treefathers. If I wanted these treasures, I could casually pick up a dozen.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The listeners were speechless. He made it sound as if these priceless treasures weren’t different from cabbages at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, what will you give me for the Reincarnation Nine-Leaves?” He amusingly stared at Dualchild.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People here finally learned the name of the immortal medicine — Reincarnation Nine-Leaves.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only someone as knowledgeable as Dualchild would know this type of grass.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dualchild narrowed his eyes and replied: “How about I become your dao protector? Give the grass to me and I’ll protect you until you become an Immortal Emperor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of many talents started to thump. To have an Emperor Assailant as a dao protector was an irresistible temptation for anyone who wanted to become emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, all wanted to see how Li Qiye would respond.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Li Qiye only smiled and shook his head: “To tell the truth, no one will become emperor in this generation but me. Having dao protectors or not will still yield the same result.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people took a deep breath after hearing this. The final battle for the Heaven’s Will had yet to begin, so who else in this world would dare to claim such a thing? Nevertheless, Li Qiye defied all logic.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, after musing for a bit, people would find that these words were quite rational. He could even cultivate thirteen palaces, what else couldn’t he do?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are many uncertainties in this world.” Dualchild slowly said: “Don’t be so confident, many geniuses have died in history.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true for others, but I am Li Qiye. Nothing is impossible for me.” Li Qiye smiled freely in response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took breaths away with this overbearing response. For many people, they wouldn’t have the courage to speak to an Emperor Assailant, let alone negotiate with one.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye, on the other hand, remained calm and nonchalant. His decisiveness alone was worthy of admiration.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what do you want to trade for the nine leaves, Young Friend?” Dualchild stared at Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye met his gaze and answered: “I’m afraid the full grass is not on the menu. However, if you want one leaf, I can give it to you for the simple exchange of your labor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked to hear this. An invincible existence like an Emperor Assailant was only worth one leaf?! This was too unbelievable. If this was the case, wouldn’t Li Qiye have enough to have nine Emperor Assailants under him?!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dualchild’s eyes slightly shifted. After a long time, he replied: “Young Friend, you should know that this is impossible. Hand me the full thing and I’ll accept your condition.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye shook his head: “If you maintain that stance, we have nothing else to say.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He naturally understood why Dualchild wanted all nine leaves. He wanted to gamble with all nine in order to live a new life again, an incredible profit!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid you don’t understand the whole picture, Young Friend.” Dualchild continued: “If I become your dao protector, everything will be different. You won’t just gain an enforcer that paves your path.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know.” Li Qiye smiled back: “You think your worth is far above that. As a child of an emperor and a treemother, you do indeed have other advantages unlike others. For example, your connections and resources. These things do add some considerable value.”</span></p><div id="footnote-8169"><p>1. Yikes, had to use treemother here.
