Their auras made many big shots turn pale in the distant.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their sects wouldn’t be able to stop this flood of steel; destruction would be inevitable.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” Powerful weapons began their attack.

Such a legion could sweep through the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Pearl was feeling the effect but it was still fine. An unbelievable scene happened before everyone. The blinding light emitting from Pearl as a defensive barrier nullified all attacks from the legion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The legion didn’t give up after the first failure.

The barrier of light had runes flowing through it as if it had experienced the augmentation of an Immortal Emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This astonished the crowd. The big shots watching from far away and Pearl’s own disciples were shocked. They didn’t think their defensive barrier was so powerful, able to stop Soaring Immortal’s offense!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder why Pearl dared to challenge Soaring Immortal.

The stronger she was, the stronger the tower would be. She never felt this before; this was like an awakening to her. There was another grand dao inside the tower waiting for her to comprehend.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The failed attacks made Soaring Immortal pause their advance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is the cavalry giving up?” A spectator commented.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, their disciples took out some strange metallic items. Who knows which metals they were made from but each piece had been refined and was full of power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Click, clack!” After the disciples laid out the foundation, the items actually put themselves together at an increasingly faster pace.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” In just a short time after the metal pieces came together, a huge giant appeared before the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Click, clack!” A total of eight giants were formed with the same process in eight different directions around Pearl.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What shocked people the most was that their body was engraved with many perfect Immortal Emperor Refined Jades! Each piece of jade was spewing out an immortal energy.

Would he be able to do so without some invincible means? The three emperors were very respectful to him so one could easily imagine his strength. In my opinion, this tower definitely came from the king. Only someone of his level could create such an amazing barrier!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People found this comment to be reasonable. Alas, the truth was the tower came from the Dark Crow. There was a great secret inside the tower. Moreover, some of the construction materials came from the Crystalfowl Immortal Mine!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The leftovers from the mine were used to create the tower.

They must pierce through Pearl’s barrier. Since they were empowered by imperial jades, they had enough power source to attack without rest. This was Soaring Immortal’s amazing sieging weapons. During a siege, the attackers would feel fatigue eventually. However, these giants could go on forever as long as there were enough jades to fuel them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For other great powers, imperial jades were too precious but they were nothing in Soaring Immortal’s eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monarch was clearly affected as the giants raged on.

As the master of the tower, her grand dao and strength were directly connected to the tower. Thus, she felt the pressure as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No time to play around with you three!” Long Aotian noticed something while fighting in the sky against Hai Lin’s group. He unleashed an invincible blow with his imperial weapon and pierced the sky. Darkness ensued and the three couldn’t withstand this attack at all. They were blown away towards the horizon; their fate unknown.</span></p>
