Unfortunately, you have met me. This is the same as courting death.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, stop running your mouth. Do you dare to come out and fight?” The Prince of Darkness answered instead of the figure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh: “I have nothing to be afraid of. However, killing all of you like that is too much of a waste. I still have uses for you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, show some courage. If you win this time, I will leave forever.” Zhentian chimed in as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye casually retorted: “A mere loser is not qualified to speak to me like that.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such words left Zhentian quivering with rage. There was nothing he could do since he wasn’t a match for Li Qiye on the battlefield or with rhetoric.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, come out and obediently surrender and we’ll spare your life.” The Conch Overlord finally joined in.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you are going to die, there’s no need to boast so shamelessly. I pity you all, you won’t even know how you’re about to die.” Li Qiye smiled in response to the provocation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice ancestor coldly challenged him: “You’re the one boasting. I want to see what you can do to break our supreme formation.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his eyes, this formation was his Ancestral Terra’s masterpiece with the combined effort of two sea gods. Because of this, he had the utmost confidence in this formation and that Li Qiye couldn’t ever break it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Break this formation, right?” Li Qiye was quite carefree: “Not the least bit challenging, it will be as simple as a meal.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Arrogant brat!” The vice ancestor was livid to hear such an outrageous answer: “Okay, come out this instant! I want to see what heaven-defying means you will employ to break my formation!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled: “Open your eyes wide and watch how I shall break this trivial formation and torture all of you!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice ancestor felt like puking blood after hearing Li Qiye refer to their masterpiece as a trivial formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the spectators in the distance watched with bated breaths. They were ready to see how Li Qiye would utilize all of his skills to break this supreme formation. They knew that he was a man of his word. If he said that he could break it, then he was definitely capable of doing so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye suddenly disappeared inside the grand momentum. The figure swept around the world but still couldn’t find him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was difficult to believe for Zhentian’s group because they had their eyes fixated on him earlier. There was no way for him to disappear right before their eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” As the figure continued its search, it suddenly exploded. The formation broke down as the refined jades were scattered. All laws were shattered. Under such a powerful blast, Zhentian’s group was completely blown away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” They couldn’t even react in time before a powerful force instantly suppressed them. It was as if a giant in the sky had trampled on all of them, completely immobilizing everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on?” No one could tell what was going on. Such a sudden reversal left them astounded. From start to finish, they had no clue as to how the great formation was broken.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, even Zhentian’s group didn’t know how Li Qiye destroyed it so quickly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye reappeared at this time. He was still standing within the grand momentum with laws appearing all over his body. Countless laws emerged everywhere on the momentum as well. At this moment, the momentum looked like the laws of the world or the laws of the ocean. It was as if every single law originated from this source. Li Qiye seemed to be fusing with these laws, as if he was part of the center.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Live by the sword, die by the sword.” Li Qiye was one with the momentum: “You borrowed some power from the momentum, but you don’t know that when I am controlling the momentum right here, I can easily detonate the power in your formation. This is too easy, you brought a wolf into your own home.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Zhentian’s group was both angry and afraid. The vice ancestor was especially furious. He didn’t expect his sect’s proudest masterpiece to be destroyed in such a simple manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Open!” They roared, wanting to repel the power pressuring them. However, despite mustering every fiber of their being, they still couldn’t escape from this power. The more they struggled, the stronger the pressure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t waste your energy. This is the suppression of the momentum, its full power, unlike the tiny portion that you borrowed earlier. Unless you are an emperor, don’t even think about moving this power.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh while looking at the group trying to overturn the suppression.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators from afar were amazed and speechless. This grand momentum was powerful to an unimaginable level. How could the four and their legions be able to escape from its pressure?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye is too devilish.” Someone had to say: “Reversing the situation like it was nothing. He is truly bizarre.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The winner takes all, we have nothing else to say. Li Qiye, do as you please. I only blame myself for not being capable enough and dying here today!” In the end, Zhentian gave up after failing to lift the suppression. He was a true man and remained proud before imminent death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this, everyone was slightly startled. The fate of the four experts and their legions were at Li Qiye’s whim. A single thought of his could decide their death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and said: “Rest assured, all of you will die. However, the process will be very painful, and you will wish for death. Don’t blame me for being ruthless, blame yourselves for letting go of the chance to run.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, Li Qiye slightly moved and the laws of the momentum followed him. A terrifying event ensued.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zzz—” A strange sound came about. Roots suddenly appeared among the thousands of experts. After growing out of their bodies, they immediately took root within the earth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” The experts among the legions turned pale from fear. They wanted to struggle but couldn’t move at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, what demonic art is this!” Even the four top experts were frightened.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is no demonic art.” Li Qiye chuckled: “This is the most esoteric law of the grand dao. You should know that after borrowing the momentum’s power, everyone’s vitality had fused. Thus, on top of the refined jades’ power, the momentum’s power had fused with your blood so its laws are inside your body! At this moment, these laws are relying on your flesh and blood to grow, that’s all.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What, what are you doing!” Even the Prince of Darkness was aghast for what was to come.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not much.” Li Qiye replied: “Didn’t you want to borrow the grand momentum’s power? You have to repay after borrowing, right? It is time for the momentum to borrow your vitality to nourish this so-called medicine of immortality so that it can mature a little earlier.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone without exception was astounded after hearing this. It wasn’t only borrowing vitality, Li Qiye might be wanting to squeeze them dry to nourish the nine leaves!</span></p>
