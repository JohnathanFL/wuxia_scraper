Soon after the words came out, they exchanged glances to the people next to them.

After losing to the True Martial Sea God, he decided to join the sea god’s banner and had many illustrious exploits. There are rumors stating that he is only inferior to the sea god by a slim margin.” A charming spirit expert was startled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone who knew about his battle record would be full of admiration.

I actually missed this the first time and had to go back and re-edit. There are two different types of seats found here, “king” and “emperor” thrones. In a normal novel, you can simply translate it as throne and it would be fine and dandy. In ED, if you don’t translate the normally unnecessary adjective, it will mess you up. Li Qiye’s chair has the word “emperor” while the other three chairs only had the word “king”. King = royal and Emperor = imperial. This is a very minor detail in Chinese. However, in order to keep this detail in English, it makes the translation sound worse, but the distinction is there. I wouldn’t do this in Spirit Vessel, but in ED, more often than not, I need to add the adjective beforehand even when it is just a normal word like “throne” or it’ll be messy; the cultivation realm is different. It does make ED a lot more wordy in comparison. All in all, the translation has been moving towards not translating superfluous words, but this does cause trouble at times versus translating each word true to the raw.</span></p>
