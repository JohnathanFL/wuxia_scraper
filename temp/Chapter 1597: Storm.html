Something is amiss here, he must have cheated. Either that or the scales aren’t working!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As someone who has been a fan of his Eldest Brother since youth, he couldn’t accept Li Qiye destroying the shadow or reaching the top since even an eonic genius like Gu Zun couldn’t do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, he wanted to nitpick or even question the validity of Li Qiye’s achievement.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many looked at him without speaking. Some found displeasure in his choice of words but they chose against speaking up since he was from Soaring Immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yulian didn’t like this statement either and gave him a cold stare. His questioning the twelve scales was the same as questioning her Yu Clan.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Immortal Emperor Yin Tian’s generation, so many people have climbed the scales without issues. It can be said that the scale was a different symbol for their clan so his skepticism was an attack on their integrity. Thus, even Yulian who had a crush on Aotian became dissatisfied with Lin Hao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye replied flatly: “Someone who can’t bear losing and having to resort to accusations like you should die.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Lin Hao immediately retorted: “Li Qiye, are you trying to silence me?! Maybe you are afraid of others finding out your trickery so you want to kill me to avoid questioning! Even if you can kill me, can you also kill everyone here?! What about everyone else in the world?! You can’t shut all of us up regardless of how many you kill!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Hao wanted to besmirch Li Qiye at this moment while dragging everyone else into the fray, onto the side of opposing Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths here stared at Lin Hao; some even moved away from him. Even a fool could see his intention.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, anyone else would try to support him in order to curry favor with Soaring Immortal. But now, they weren’t going to joke around when facing Fiercest, a mass murderer. If Lin Hao were to really drag them into this mess, Fiercest would kill them without hesitation. They didn’t want to be buried alongside Lin Hao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just a clown thinking that he’s something, deserving of punishment.” Li Qiye glanced emotionlessly at the guy and casually slapped.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Lin Hao couldn’t even dodge in time or block it. He was blown flying with blood and teeth falling out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He fell on the ground but his words were still strong: “Li Qiye, even if you kill me, the rest of the world will still know the truth. Do it! Soaring Immortal disciples have never been afraid of death!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just a worm, you think I care what others say about me?” Li Qiye replied: “If you wish to die, so be it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, he pointed his finger at the youth. It was the most casual of strikes but Lin Hao couldn’t dodge at all. The gap between the two was too immense so Lin Hao closed his eyes, awaiting death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Show mercy!” A shout came about at this key juncture. A loud banging noise came next with a breaking sound. Debris went flying everywhere.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge shield flew forward to stop Li Qiye’s finger strike. It was still destroyed completely with pieces scattering everywhere. Nevertheless, Lin Hao was able to survive the ordeal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strapping old man landed down in front of Lin Hao. More shields emerged around him while he held a saber, ready to fight without the slightest sign of carelessness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!” Lin Hao shouted happily and crawled up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, our warships are coming right away.” The old man nodded but his eyes remained fixated on Li Qiye. He was consoling his disciple while telling everyone here at the same time, especially Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An elder from Soaring Immortal.” One youth was aghast.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd quickly retreated since they understood the implication of an incoming warship.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though an elder wasn’t considered a high-ranking member in Soaring Immortal, he still emitted a frightening aura. Just an elder was already this powerful. It was indicative of the sect’s strength as a whole.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder looked at Li Qiye and said slowly: “Fellow Daoist Li, my disciple is young and ignorant, how about sparing him and showing our sect some sensibilities?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was still ready for battle, not daring to underestimate the enemy. He has heard of Fiercest a long time ago. This was a being capable of murdering Godkings and banishing their sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was moved after hearing this. Ever since Soaring Immortal descended down on the Grand Sea, they have always been imperious. Those who opposed them would be flattened for sure! Alas, this elder had to play nice at this moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then again, it wasn’t shameful at all for him to act in this manner. After all, his enemy was the notorious Fiercest who has never been afraid of anyone ever since his debut. The name Soaring Immortal couldn’t scare him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye looked at him and chuckled: “Show some sensibilities? Not for your Soaring Immortal Sect!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder’s expression soured after hearing this. Even imperial lineages would show their sect some respect but not Li Qiye at this moment. The elder found it difficult to remain calm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Li, the grand dao is long, you will always see others again.” The elder took a deep breath and said slowly: “It’s better to make a friend than an enemy. Our sect isn’t that easily bullied!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what? Does everyone need to give you some face just because you had five emperors?” Li Qiye still didn’t respond but a sneer came from the distance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A youth arrived with a golden luster emanating from his body. He had golden scales all over his body with two green dragon horns. A stormy tsunami accompanied him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hai Lin!” One of the spectators recognized him and became startled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those who haven’t seen him in the past knew who he was: “The young leader of the sea demons!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder uttered coldly: “So you are hiding here but not for long, our young lord will kill you soon enough.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know Long Aotian and his hounds are looking for me.” The youth named Hai Lin snorted: “They won’t find shit on their trip to the sea this time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder scowled: “You can run for now but not forever. He’ll slay all of you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait until he becomes emperor before boasting.” Hai Lin retorted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths present were quiet.

This invoked the retaliation from the presiding demons and sea monsters.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sea monsters weren’t a race.
