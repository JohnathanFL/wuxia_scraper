The prince couldn’t break through the dominating solar flames since he couldn’t withstand its heat. Meanwhile, the Void Physique allowed him to be completely undetectable, so Yonghuang couldn’t kill him either.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the spectators now understood that Yonghuang was also unaffected by the suppression from Godhalt. A while ago, she was wounded by the prince due to this suppression, but without it, the prince had no advantage to speak of.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” The space around her began to melt like liquid similar to the snow in spring.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, Seashield was changing his strategy. After several unsuccessful ambushes, he has decided to refine space instead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Void Physique was capable of this task. At this moment, he was still nowhere to be seen, but the surrounding space turned into a furnace that began to burn with an invisible flame.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd felt anxious after seeing this. The majority thought that the prince could decide the outcome of this battle with this move.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” With the hissing of fire, the unbelievable happened. The location where Yonghuang stood crazily shrunk. The large amount of sunfire was being compressed into the space around her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, her flame was all-encompassing and devastated the void. But now, it was being pushed down by a powerful force and became a small fireball.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fireball was wildly collapsing like a sun. One could easily imagine the power contained within. All of the melted space around it was also condensed into a tiny section. The collapsing of this sun also made the space around it shrink.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Yonghuang’s chance to counterattack. The prince wanted to refine space while she was waiting for this moment in order to make the space inside collapse entirely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” After the process reached a certain level, this space suddenly exploded with an incredible power. Space itself shattered into little pieces and left behind only black holes and indelible scars in the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff!” Blood spurted out. The prince, who was refining space, was affected by this blast. He couldn’t suppress this space any longer. The explosion blew him outside, causing him to spew out blood as his body seemed to be crushed and battered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” Before he had the time to stand, the broken fragments of space along with the refined fire instantly turned into a dao chapter. It diligently followed the prince and left behind a mark on his body that would last as long as the prince was still stained with the presence of space.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Void Physique specialized in hiding in space, so how could he not be touched by it? Because of this, he couldn’t escape the mark left by this dao chapter.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Yonghuang’s counterattack. The fragmented pieces of space had fused with her flames after the monstrous explosion and turned into this chapter. This made it impossible for the prince to escape from being marked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” Right when he was injured, he vanished again and hid in the void.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yonghuang didn’t even bother looking this time. With a loud bang, she raised her hand and a gigantic fire dragon roared. Next, a huge dragon claw slammed down and blotted out the sun.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space shattered while the prince, who was in hiding, was blown away again. He spat out another mouthful of blood, but his speed was still fast enough to disappear once more after the initial contact.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The other claw of this dragon slammed down and shattered the region again, blowing the stealthy prince away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang! Bang!” The nearby space continued to be smashed. Regardless of how he tried to evade Yonghuang’s Extreme Yang Physique, the prince had nowhere to hide.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was extremely difficult for him to run due to the mark imprinted on his body. The only way was for him to abandon this fight and run far away. Of course, Yonghuang wouldn’t be able to hold him back should he choose to do this. After all, she was no match for him with regard to spatial movement.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no doubt that she has found the flaws of the Void Physique. Her mark from the fusion of her fire and fragmented space allowed her to detect him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ordinary mark could be dispelled by the prince in a brief moment. However, due to the nature of its parts, it wasn’t easy for him to do so for this particular mark.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Too weak.” Li Qiye flatly spoke without looking: “An imperfect Void Physique cannot compete with a perfect Extreme Yang Physique.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had expected this outcome long ago. Even though the Roaring Conch’s Void Physique had been improved and derived from two generations of sea gods and was heading towards perfection, it was inferior to the real deal from the scripture itself. This made it possible for Yonghuang to find its weakness during this battle. Thus, the prince could only await his death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Open!” In the end, the prince knew that he couldn’t erase this mark, so he had to counterattack and used his killing move. With his cry, the space around him fluctuated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” With a loud blast, nine Seashield Princes appeared. He has finally used his greatest technique — Nine Images Physique Art.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” His cry echoed across the world. All nine of them wore the sea god gloves that poured out an endless light, illuminating the sky. It looked like a storm of brilliant powder falling down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, he was using the power of his gloves as well in order to destroy Su Yonghuang right away!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the beginning, he didn’t want to rely on these gloves. Unless there was no other way, he would rather use his own power to kill her — this would boost his prestige even more. If he used his sect’s strongest weapon to kill her, outsiders would think that this was an empty victory.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” All of the sunfire returned to Yonghuang. Her nine palaces soared to the sky and formed a kingdom.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kingdom was extremely vast and contained an inexhaustible sunfire. The fire turned into countless creatures. There were dragons flying in the sky and elves swimming in a sea of flames. All of these existences here were worshipping the many sun gods inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Yonghuang stood there with sun palaces behind her. They were all created from solar metal with a sun god presiding in each one. All of them were giving birth to the most tyrannical flame in this world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the ruler of this kingdom, the supreme sun goddess. Inside this kingdom, everyone was subject to her punishment and suppression!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four palaces to form a domain, eight to form a kingdom. She had nine, thus she could create a kingdom with herself as the ultimate sun goddess.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the prince, with his best techniques, was sucked into this kingdom. With a loud bang, all nine princes were suppressed. To a certain extent, even the gloves weren’t spared from this fate. Their brilliance that was blinding the sky earlier has dimmed down quite a bit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All nine princes howled: “Break for me!” They wished to tear apart this kingdom and destroy Yonghuang.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this critical moment, nine monstrous palms came down. Each of them was accompanied by the laws of a sea god. They came crashing down on the entire kingdom and caused it to tremble. The sun gods in the palaces felt this immense pressure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power of a sea god was ravaging this world. The prince was already powerful, so he was able to use these gloves to an outstanding level.</span></p>
