It was as if he could see through to the new creature inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the treecorpses in the valley had made several more attempts that all resulted in failure. They simply couldn’t get close to the dead corpse.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, Ego King, what are you waiting for, hurry and save it!” She became quite anxious for these treecorpses, unlike Li Qiye who was completely indifferent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t pay attention to her as his eyes became incomparably deep in order to gaze at the new life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, he gently sighed and said: “Maybe this thing is connected to me by fate since the new momentum will start because of me.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, he pulled Xiaoxiao and jumped into the valley.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their sudden intrusion alerted all the treecorpses in this place. They turned around and glared at the two with their eyes full of deathly energy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone else would be creeped out by these pupils.

She didn’t reject him and went with the flow. Wherever Li Qiye’s vitality reached, her own followed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” Her entire body lit up and bright halos emerged around her. These halos began to spin. Moreover, inside these halos were blinding and magnificent solar flares. With their rotation, each halo seemed like its own great world that could accommodate trillions of existences. As they began to pulse and spread out like a peacock’s tail behind her, three thousand great worlds behind her were opening.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her brilliance engulfed this entire world. The whole process made her appear quite lofty.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” A peerless world opened behind her with the shadow of a great tree.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This tree was unimaginably large. Each leaf carried a star of their own with galaxies floating around the branches while worlds were hanging above. It looked just like a World Tree, the start of all life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this epic world opened, it also had Ye Xiaoxiao’s dignified and holy aura, making her seem as if she was the ruler of all creations. With the emergence of the tree, all the treecorpses stared at Ye Xiaoxiao with reverence. They quickly backed off and didn’t dare to stay close to her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t only because of their respect for her aura. More importantly, they seemed to be afraid of staining her with their foul aura. In their eyes, even a small strand of their foul energy touching her was blasphemy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why is it like this?” Ye Xiaoxiao was very confused at the treecorpses’ actions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye revealed: “Because your bloodline is sacred and they are afraid of staining you. This is an instinctive feeling, so they don’t dare to come close.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He withdrew his palm, but the light around her body raged on. He ordered: “Stay here, do not come forward no matter what happens.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She quickly nodded: “I understand, you go save the baby.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye slowly inched forward while looking at the big belly. He opened his fate palace and the pillar, tree, cauldron, and spring of life all appeared at the same time once he got closer to the corpse lying on top of the tree. He let the pillar and cauldron protect his left and right.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all four images of the fate palace appeared, he was even closer to the dead corpse.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Crackle!” A terrifying bolt of lightning shot for him without any mercy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the pillar of life immediately protected him and absorbed this type of energy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Crackle! Crackle!” A burst of thunder sounded. The new life crazily unleashed a relentless torrent of lightning.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such fierce lightning could render anyone to ashes. However, runes appeared on the pillar of life. Under their protection, it didn’t matter how terrorizing and powerful these bolts of lightning were. They couldn’t amount to anything nor were they capable of hurting Li Qiye due to the Ancient Void Rune being capable of devouring all lightning and curses.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the pillar of life withstood the torrent of lightning, Li Qiye slowly walked towards the lying corpse.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Poof!” The new life in the belly unleashed an endless flame. This was the peerless fire of life that was capable of burning everything in this world. However, the cauldron quickly sucked in this powerful flame without leaving the tiniest spark.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, the new life continued to crazily send out more flames as if wanting to destroy anything that comes close.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” It was all useless after the sound of a lock clicking came about. The raging fire couldn’t hurt Li Qiye’s cauldron at all since the Heavenly Dao’s Primal Chapter had fortified the cauldron.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The branches of his tree of life swooped down towards the protruding belly. They gently patted it with their aura of life like the return of spring. Each gentle touch could melt snow. It was gentle and delicate with great vitality, calming down the restless lifeform inside. It was gradually becoming effective. The restless life calmed down and both the lightning and flames slowly dissipated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Li Qiye was standing next to the corpse. Xiaoxiao, with her heart hanging on a thread, finally heaved a sigh of relief after seeing this scene. Even the treecorpses became relieved. They didn’t attack Li Qiye since they knew what he was trying to do.</span></p>
