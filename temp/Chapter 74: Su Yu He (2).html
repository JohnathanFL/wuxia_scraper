<p>Li Qiye allowed for Immortal Emperor Min Ren to perform a ceremony for her crossing, so that she could go in peace. However, unfortunately, this strand of yearning sentiment was unwilling to go, and Immortal Emperor Min Ren was too merciful to forcefully send her away. This was why she had always remained in this place, alongside the ancient zither, without a way of departure!</p><p>Recalling the past, even Li Qiye, who had experienced countless years, still couldn’t help but to sentimentally sigh.</p><p>Thinking up to here, Li Qiye looked at the peerless shadow and said: “You said that after the ancient zither sunk into the ground, you also went into a deep slumber; why are you now causing havoc? From my view, this is not a simple ghost matter. The world’s spirit energy here has been contaminated. You are merely a yearning sentiment, so you don’t have the power to have such a big influence; there must be a different reason.”</p><p>Su Yu He’s yearning sentiment responded: “After the ancient zither went into the ground, I also went into a deep slumber with it. I do not know how long I was asleep for. There was a commotion afterward; an evil energy pollution disturbed me, so I woke up. I was staying here, and I didn’t want to be bothered; so I scared the disciples away from this place.”</p><p>Li Qiye’s eyes became serious, and he asked: “Evil energy invaded?”</p><p>The peerless shadow couldn’t help but say: “Your Excellency, from my point of view, there is a chance that the mysterious ground under the earth is the cause.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Li Qiye’s expression greatly changed from his always calm demeanor and into a stern one. His eyes suddenly jumped, and he gravely stated: “There is zero chance! That year, I brought along the little brat Min Ren with the Old Chicken Head’s group to kill until the heaven falls and the earth rends in order to forcefully seal it. With little brat Min Ren carrying the Heaven’s Will under my order; he came inside one more time in order to use a matchless sealing technique in that place. The mysterious land definitely cannot escape the sealing of little brat Min Ren; this I have the utmost confidence in.”</p><p>The peerless shadow frightenedly replied: “I’m afraid that this is absolutely true; this evil energy is too familiar to me. This feeling, I know it all too well. After I had awoken, no matter the place, I always had this uneasy feeling; it was as if a small amount of evil energy was escaping from the ground.”</p><p>The words of the peerless shadow caused Li Qiye’s heart to plummet. Even though she was only a yearning sentiment of Su Yu He, this matter, to her, had too much influence. If she said so, then it definitely would not be wrong.</p><p>He had confidence in Immortal Emperor Min Ren, plus this matter was related to the eternal inheritance of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; Min Ren must have been extremely cautious. With the unbeatable methods of Min Ren as an Immortal Emperor, Li Qiye had no reason to doubt him. As long as he suppressed and sealed this place, the evil energy had no chance of escaping the confinement of Min Ren.</p><p>However, now there was a strange occurrence; what actually happened below the earth? Li Qiye’s eyes focused, and after a while, he turned towards the peerless shadow, saying: “It seems like there are some things that I need to change my plans around. When it is time, I will open your grave. If it is really necessary, I will bury you under the peach tree first.”</p><p>“Thank you, Your Excellency.” The peerless shadow gently bowed. She was only a strand of yearning sentiment, and she existed only to be a pair to the ancient zither. She still had some mysterious power, but she had no way of burying herself.</p><p>Li Qiye gently stroked the ancient zither in his hands. This ancient zither, he was too familiar with it. The time when Min Ren had only started to practice the zither, he gave this ancient zither to Min Ren. Even though this zither was not an epic treasure, after experiencing Min Ren’s touch throughout the years, especially after he had become an Immortal Emperor, its essence greatly changed.</p><p>Li Qiye properly put the ancient zither away, and then carefully observed the densely packed melodic patterns inside the Ghost Pavilion.</p><p>Seeing Li Qiye in a daze and looking at the patterns, she couldn’t help but ask: “Your Excellency, do want to borrow the melodic patterns?”</p><p>Li Qiye lightly shook his head, and he said: “The descendants of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect are all bags of straws. This mountain of treasure is in front of them, yet they are unable to recognize it. The melodic patterns in this Ghost Pavilion have absorbed a large amount of emperor’s power and immortal intent; this heavenly aura is enough for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to survive through many difficult moons, yet these people are putting all of their gazes on Immortal Emperor Life Treasures and Emperor merit laws!"</p><p>The Zither Pavilion, even though this was not the resting place of Min Ren, but it was the place Min Ren had come to countless times to play the zither, especially after he became an Immortal Emperor.</p><p>As an Immortal Emperor carrying the Heaven’s Will, shouldering the universe, and exerting endless immortal pressure, any object that was touched by his heavenly aura would obtain amazing benefits. It can be imagined that after Min Ren had received the Heaven’s Will, each of his heavenly melodies, with its godly aura, contained numerous profound truths.</p><p>This Zither Pavilion was basked in the sound of Immortal Emperor Min Ren’s melodies again and again. The melodic patterns not only contained the aura of Min Ren, but it also contained the hidden profound truths of the grand Dao.</p><p>One could say, the densely packed melodic patterns in this pavilion contained a matchless Dao of zither melody. If one used these zither patterns to embark on the Dao, they could definitely achieve an incredible grand Dao cultivation.</p><p>However, Li Qiye was not interested in the Dao of the zither. He only wanted to borrow the emperor’s power and immortal intent hidden within these patterns. The ancient zither in his hand and the melodies played by Min Ren, he knew them like the back of his hand because he was the one that taught Min Ren. He could unleash a frightening power from this ancient zither using Min Ren’s emperor’s power and immortal intent.</p><p>The moment when Li Qiye was being punished at the Ghost Pavilion, there was also a heavenly frightening event happening at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>This day, outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, there was a huge ancient ship flying towards them. This ship was extremely big, it was the length of ten miles. When it flew in the sky, it cast a frightening shadow on the ground.</p><p>The ancient ship resembled a mobile fortress. It absorbed and spat out ancient brilliant lights. The body of the ship was engraved with magical runes and formations that were moving continuously, emancipating the power of the grand Dao. Without a doubt, this ship could not only fly in the sky, but it could also defend itself against cultivators’ attacks.</p><p>On this ancient ship, a crimson blood energy, along with an ancient Royal Noble aura, poured down freely without any intention of suppressing itself. The rolling power of the Royal Noble aura was felt by the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect disciples, even from afar.</p><p>This type of arrival, it was not a friendly visit; it was a clear provocation against the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!</p><p>The moment the ancient ship arrived at the outskirts of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, eight hundred soldiers from the ship simultaneously roared, it was as powerful as a rolling tsunami that encompassed the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. It deafeningly shook the ears of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect disciples, and caused their blood energies to run amok!</p><p>In a flash, the sound of bells ringing echoed throughout the entire sect, warning the disciples that enemies were approaching!</p><p>However, even though the ancient ship arrived at the sect, it didn’t start its attack. The giant ancient ship simply stopped beyond the boundary of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>In the midst of everything, both the top and bottom of the sect were alarmed. It was not only the sectional leaders and protectors; even the six elders were unable to sit still in their chairs.</p><p>The moment First Elder left the main peak, he saw a flag on the ancient ship that was embroidered with the word “War”, and he couldn’t help but darken his expression! At the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, Royal Nobles that could have the word “War” on their ship like this could be counted on one’s fingers. Currently, he didn’t have to look; he already knew who the person was.</p><p>“Lie Zhan Hou!”</p><p>A Royal Noble whose title was bestowed upon by the Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, as well as one of the strongest Royal Nobles within the kingdom. Even though he did not originate from the Heavenly God Sect but from another big sect, he pledged his loyalty to the Mortal King. He had accomplished many remarkable military achievements. At the frontier of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, there were countless smaller sects that were stamped out by his hands!</p><p>Lie Zhan Hou was not only a brave general of the kingdom, but he was also a renowned ruthless character.</p><p>Lie Zhan Hou brought along eight hundred soldiers to the outskirts of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This matter did not simply just alarm the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but it also alarmed the other sects within the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom; especially the closest ones to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. They became frightened with the appearance of the ancient ship.</p><p>“The warship of Lie Zhan Hou, could it be that the marquis is personally going into battle?” Seeing this ancient ship, countless cultivators were surprised.</p><p>A nearby sect master’s expression darkened, and he said: “After his title bestowment, the marquis rarely left the kingdom capital. Why did he suddenly appear here without any indications!”</p><p>The appearance of the ancient ship caused many cultivators to secretly follow. Seeing it stop right outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect made these cultivators glance at each other, filled with astonishment.</p><p>A sect master’s face changed colors as he quietly mumbled: “Could it be that Lie Zhan Hou is personally attacking the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?” At the moment, many powerful characters thought about many different outcomes.</p><p>The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Heavenly God Sect were mortal enemies. Today, the Heavenly God Sect created the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and it was erected on the remains of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s old kingdom; the kingdom was an even bigger territory.</p><p>The war that occurred thirty thousand years ago, the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect personally took action, and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was utterly defeated. With their miserable defeat, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect couldn’t do anything outside of returning to the ancestral land.</p><p>After the grand defeat, the Heavenly God Sect didn’t use this opportunity to give chase; its ancestor also didn’t personally slaughter the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. During the decline of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, both of the sects still had minor skirmishes; however, the Heavenly God Sect still did not destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>Regarding this matter, within the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and even the Grand Middle Territory, there were many different versions of rumors circulating. Some said that the Heavenly God Sect did not destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect because it still had a living monstrous ancestor who was extremely powerful; even the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect wasn’t sure that he could destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect in one breath.</p><p>There was another rumor that the Heavenly God Sect ancestor wasn’t sure that he could destroy the emperor foundation of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Even though the sect had declined, in the end, it was still a sect created by an Immortal Emperor. On top of this holy ground, the foundation built by an Immortal Emperor could not be shaken. The Heavenly God Sect was not confident in attacking this emperor foundation.</p><p>A different rumor had it that because the Immortal Emperor True Treasure of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still existed, the Heavenly God Sect couldn’t destroy it. As long as the Immortal Emperor True Treasure remained in their hands, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would not be destroyed!</p><p>No matter what, to sum it up, after the Heavenly God Sect’s victory over the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the founding of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, the Heavenly God Sect had never directly attacked the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>A few ten thousand years quickly passed, and suddenly, the warship of Lie Zhan Hou appeared outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; how could others not be surprised?</p>
