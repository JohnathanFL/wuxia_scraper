<p><b>Chapter 678: Starshattering Bow</b></p><p>Even the haughty Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but stare suspiciously at Li Qiye. This sudden change was extremely strange and unlike his usual style at all. In this short period of time, she didn’t know where the problem was, but she still arrogantly smiled and said: “Come, let us pick a nice location for your burial.”</p><p>Li Qiye ignored her and prodded the bull before closing his eyes to rest in the carriage, leaving the bull to take him away.</p><p>Jian Wushuang also didn’t care for whatever Li Qiye was plotting as she followed behind him. In her mind, no matter what he was planning, it was not worth mentioning since she could easily crush his schemes.</p><p>Eventually, Li Qiye found a place that was not only beautiful, but also remote without signs of others on their way. After arriving, Li Qiye took another look around and was quite pleased with himself.</p><p>“Good, this is the place. A beautiful scenery, quiet and elegant without any disturbance. Nothing could be better than this for my resting place.” Said Li Qiye with a leisurely smile after jumping down from the carriage.</p><p>He patted the bull’s head, then the bull dragged the carriage away, disappearing instantly.</p><p>At this time, Jian Wushuang was standing on top of a hill, looking down at Li Qiye as she coldly sneered: “You have found your grave, so get ready to die.”</p><p>She had always been a proud person who enjoyed standing on the high ground. Looking down on all existences with disdain gave her a sense of superiority.</p><p>Li Qiye also stopped on a peak and took a look around. He took out the Nine Words True Bow and slowly said: “Okay, I am ready, but do not disappoint me. If you can’t kill me, then I would have to jump off a building to kill myself.”</p><p>Li Qiye’s words made no sense and caused others to think that he was tired of living. Even Jian Wushuang found it strange. Her eyes became serious and seemed like two sharp arrows locked onto Li Qiye.</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about that since you will die to my arrow. However, since you are so compliant, I will leave your corpse intact.” Said Jian Wushuang with a sneer. With that, she slowly took out a long bow.</p><p>The moment this long bow appeared, it was as if a star had fallen from the sky. The bow appeared to be a star in her hand, taking in and spewing out cold starlight. Although the starlight was not dazzling, it gave off the feeling that it could illuminate the entire sky.</p><p>Each individual streak of starlight was like a divine arrow that was capable of piercing gods and firmaments all the same. All of the arrows had a merciless intent that sent chills deep into people’s bones.</p><p>“The Starshattering Bow.” Li Qiye smiled after seeing the bow in her hand and freely smiled: “It seems that you really are the favorite daughter of the Jian Clan. To think they actually passed down this bow to you. This is truly a good bow. When Immortal Emperor Diyi Jian was young, this was his weapon of choice while battling the nine heavens and ten earths…”</p><p>“... This bow was refined using the deepest star in the sky of the Mortal Emperor World, a star that spanned for tens of millions of miles was turned into this one bow. Although it didn’t come from your patriarch, it still accepted the nourishment of his blood energy on top of being powerful already.” Li Qiye mused after seeing this bow.</p><p>Jian Wushuang was surprised to hear Li Qiye’s knowledge regarding the origin of her bow. She sneered and said: “You do know a lot!”</p><p>Li Qiye didn’t mind at all and continued: “That’s not all I know. Although people say that Immortal Emperor Diyi Jian used the bow to prove his dao, this was actually not the case. Before shouldering the Heaven’s Will, your patriarch had once thrown away the Starshattering Bow and trained with a different type of weapon until he finally became an emperor! Thus, your emperor didn’t use the bow to prove his dao.”</p><p>“So what?!” Although Jian Wushuang was slightly stunned, she still harshly said: “Since the start of time, my ancestor alone was invincible with regards to archery; his archery skill was number one!”</p><p>“I will not deny that.” Li Qiye said with a relaxed smile: “Immortal Emperor Diyi Jian, after becoming an emperor, had done one thing that many emperors did not do. He cut off part of his body and burned it down to form a bow. Just like that, the number one bow across the eons was born. Its power was no weaker than your patriach’s true fate weapon. It could even be said to have surpassed the limits. Only with that bow in his hand was your patriarch’s archery considered unbeatable, becoming capable of looking down on all the other emperors!”</p><p>Li Qiye’s tale left Jian Wushuang in a daze for a while because not too many people knew about this story. How could a no-named junior like Li Qiye recall it so well with such familiarity? This was outside of her expectations.</p><p>Li Qiye happily said: “Unfortunately, the bow in your hand is only the Starshattering Bow. If you were wielding your patriarch’s bow, then I would actually not try to court death so carelessly. However, this is a good thing since killing me with the Starshattering Bow is quite appropriate.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I will be using a different bow very soon.” Jian Wushuang sneered and drily said: “Wait until I kill you, then I will replace it with the bow in your hand.”</p><p>She was indeed worthy of being the golden daughter of the Jian Clan. She never cared about other people’s weapons since, to her, they couldn’t compare to her own.</p><p>However, she was tempted this time. Although she already had the Starshattering Bow, she was still moved by the Nine Words True Bow in Li Qiye’s hand. Intuition told her that his bow was even better and more powerful than her own.</p><p>“You have a very keen vision.” Li Qiye laughed and gently stroked the bow in his hand as he leisurely said: “This bow is the best bow throughout all of eternity, it is completely peerless. In the future, this bow of mine will be even stronger than your patriarch’s bow.”</p><p>“Even a better bow would only be rotting in your hands.” Jian Wushuang arrogantly declared: “Only in my grasp will it become the number one bow in all of history!”</p><p>Although she was an arrogant bully and was quite annoying, it was still quite cute. At the very least, she was frank about it, unlike some other geniuses who only made up excuses to satisfy their greed for the possessions of others.</p><p>“Are you saying that I should be happy for my bow now that it has met you?” Li Qiye relaxingly said: “However, I am in a good mood this time, so I won’t hold that comment against an ugly girl like you. If you actually manage to kill me, then I’ll fulfill your wish, I shall give this bow to you.” [1. Ugly girl here really means ugly girl, but older people use it in a teasing/familiar/doting manner as well.]</p><p>She trembled with rage after hearing Li Qiye’s words. Although she couldn’t call herself the number one beauty in the Stone Medicine World, she was still within the top ten. The men who courted her could line up from the north to the south side of this entire world, so how could she not be enraged by this nobody calling her an ugly girl?</p><p>Earlier, she felt that Li Qiye’s mouth had become less toxic, but now, she only wanted to break his jaws.</p><p>Of course, Li Qiye didn’t care about her mood. He only smiled and waved his sleeve to say: “Since you want me to die, I’ll let you have the first move.”</p><p>Jian Wushuang’s murderous intent was surging due to her anger. But in the end, she was still an imperial descendant. She took a deep breath to calm her emotions and maintained her best possible condition. She glared at him and arrogantly said: “You dare to let me attack first in an archery battle? Do you really think you can escape from my arrow? But I am merciful so I will give you a chance to change your weapon!”</p><p>The innately proud Jian Wushuang thought that Li Qiye daring to compete in archery with her was truly a foolish decision, and she didn’t want to take advantage of him.</p><p>In response, Li Qiye leisurely smiled and said: “No need, I will use this bow instead of changing weapons.”</p><p>“In that case, prepare to die!” Jian Wushuang didn’t want to waste her breath anymore as a glint flashed in her sharp eyes while she held her bow.</p><p>At this critical moment, Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said: “Wait a minute.”</p><p>Jian Wushuang rolled her eyes at Li Qiye and sneered: “Oh? Regretting it now? It is too late though! Only death awaits you today!”</p><p>Li Qiye chuckled and leisurely uttered: “Who says I’m changing my mind? It’s just that I don’t want others to watch on the sideline.”</p><p>With that, he drew his bow and prepared an arrow. With a wind-destroying whistle, the arrow shot all the way to the sky.</p><p>“Pop!” The sound of something breaking emanated from the sky, followed by what seemed to be pieces of glass falling down. It was as if a heavenly mirror had been shattered by his arrow.</p><p>“Good shot.” Said Jian Wushuang drily as she gazed at the sky and saw the falling broken pieces.</p><p>After Li Qiye destroyed the item in the sky, a carriage could be found stopped outside of the Celestial Peak Mountain on a certain hill, one that couldn’t look any more ordinary.</p><p>There was a heavenly mirror inside the carriage that also shattered into countless pieces after Li Qiye destroyed the one in the sky.</p><p>This caused the old woman sitting in the carriage to startlingly stand up with a fierce glare; this was a pair of frightening eyes with an entire rotating galaxy inside. These eyes illuminated the world when they aimed for the horizon.</p><p>“Grandma, no need to rush. I can still sense them a little bit. He has great senses so we don’t need to get too close.” At this time, a very pleasant voice came from inside the carriage as if it was the hymn of an immortal. Many would most likely become bewildered by this voice.</p><p>If Li Qiye was here, he would be able to recognize this carriage because it was the one that trod the same path as him all the way from the Giant Bamboo Country to the Celestial Peak Mountain.</p><p>At this moment, during the confrontation between Li Qiye and Jian Wushuang, Li Qiye stood there in a comfortable manner; he was very casual as if this was not a duel at all.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
