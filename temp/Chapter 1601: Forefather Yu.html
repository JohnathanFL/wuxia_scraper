I will be going to see the forefather.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disciples present were moved after hearing this for they understood the significance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestor traveled deeper into the mansion until he reached a shabby house. He tidied his clothes without any slight and prostrated before the door: “Your grandson greets you, forefather.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come in.” A powerful sound came from within.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestor took a deep breath and entered the building. It was very neat with nothing else but a straw mat with an old man meditating on top.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a large stature and wore a hemp garment without any adornments. His gray hair was shining as he sat straight like a rock.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Forefather Yu. Descendants no longer knew his real name. They only knew that he was Yu Taijun’s only son.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the second Godking from the clan, a very powerful Nine Worlds’ Godking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clan once had five Godkings. Outside of Taijun who was an Emperor Assailant, her husband was also a terrifying Godking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another Godking was the Yu Ancestor’s father, or the Forefather Yu’s son. He was also another powerful Godking.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, these two Godkings were no longer in this world. Their lives ran out among the slow path towards the grand dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just think about it, a clan that wasn’t an imperial lineage actually had five Godkings and one Emperor Assailant. Despite its small scale, its power and prestige were mighty enough. These Godkings were the reason why the Yu Clan had an illustrious position in the Grand Sea.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing the forefather, the ancestor bowed again and said: “Forefather, I’m afraid we are facing a strong enemy. He had climbed on our twelve scales and used its power.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know.” The forefather slowly nodded: “Who is he?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A junior named Li Qiye. He came from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect with no real backing to speak of.” The ancestor busily answered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, Cleansing Incense.” The forefather murmured these two names and fell into quiet contemplation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He came with ill-will. First, he seriously injured our descendant and tortured him. Then he tore apart my grandnephew’s arm. This is a very aggressive man. Right now, he’s using our twelve scales to destroy the Skyfire Warships. I’m afraid he’s coming for us soon.” The ancestor worriedly said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His nervousness was understandable. Li Qiye came aggressively and seemed to be aiming for his clan. Moreover, he has heard of Li Qiye’s title, Fiercest, as well as the notoriety accompanying it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elaborate.” The forefather inquired.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestor told Yu Zhan’s story again and how he and his uncle were taught a lesson by Li Qiye. They reported the matter to the clan master and the clan master, in turn, reported it to the ancestor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this, the forefather gently waved his sleeve and said flatly: “Let the juniors take care of their own problem. The boy is to blame for not being skilled enough and lose. Tell him to train harder. The only thing to worry about right now is the twelve scales.” He frowned after saying this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm…” Ancestor Yu mulled over the statement as well. He was a bit surprised that his grandfather didn’t want to step up for their descendant. However, he didn’t dare to remark on it because his grandfather was much more insightful than him. He surely had his reasons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’ll be a problem for Fiercest to have control over the twelve scales. We need to eliminate this to avoid further complication.” Ancestor Yu said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The forefather took his time thinking before answering: “Nothing is surprising since there are many great yet hidden masters in the world. However, in our generation, there should only be two people who can completely understand the twelve scales.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which two?” The ancestor said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The first is Gu Zun from Heaven Suppression. His talents are virtually peerless.” The forefather replied: “If he really wants to, he can definitely understand the mysteries within. It’s just that Mother is still around so he doesn’t want to antagonize her.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is the second then?” The ancestor didn’t doubt Gu Zun’s talents. After all, this was an eonic genius.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The second… you won’t know this person, no need for me to waste words.” The forefather’s eyes flashed for a bit but he refused to answer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This astounded the ancestor. Just what kind of terrifying characters could this be that even his grandfather didn’t want to comment on?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye comes with menacing intent but he’s probably not on the same side as Gu Zun.” The ancestor said quickly: “We’re on the same side as Heaven Suppression with good ties with Ye Jiuzhou’s people. Gu Zun doesn’t need to aim for us, plus, Li Qiye also erased Gu Zun’s shadow on the scales.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t predict Gu Zun’s actions with an ordinary perspective.” The forefather shook his head: “To call Gu Zun a genius is not unreasonable but to call him a stubborn madman is fine as well. A simple junior like you can’t speculate his thoughts.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestor obediently kept his mouth shut.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother will be out tomorrow. Select a few descendants and let them see her because she might not see your group again later. As for Li Qiye, she’ll make a decision.” The forefather said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Her Venerable wants to come out!” The ancestor was ecstatic. Though the world knew that she was finished with her cultivation, she still hasn’t left her meditation. No one in the mansion was qualified to see her outside of Forefather Yu.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go.” The forefather ended with a wave of his sleeve.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The happy ancestor took a deep breath and bowed again before turning to leave.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One more thing, no need to be so close with Soaring Immortal. We do not walk on the same path with them.” The forefather added.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestor was dazed for a while. He eventually calmed down and had to comment: “Soaring Immortal indeed wants to befriend us. If we have an ally like them, the benefits will come.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the seniors in the clan knew of Yu Yulian’s crush on Long Aotian and were happy to see it coming to fruition. Even Ancestor Yu wouldn’t mind her marrying into Soaring Immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The forefather raised his voice: “What do you know?! In the eyes of Soaring Immortal, we are only tools to be used. Just shallow juniors like you are qualified to talk about an alliance with Soaring Immortal? Hmph, allying with them will bring about a sect-destroying disaster.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well…” The ancestor hesitated and didn’t know what to say since deep down, he wanted to form this alliance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just keep this in mind, no need to investigate any further.
