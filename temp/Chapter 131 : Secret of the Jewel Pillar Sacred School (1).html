<p><strong><b>Chapter 131 :&nbsp;Secret of the Jewel Pillar Sacred School (1)</b></strong></p><p>“Little demon, stop bragging in this place. If there really is danger, then I’m afraid you would be too slow protecting just yourself!”</p><p>Chen Baojiao angrily glared at Li Qiye. Even though she said this, her impression of Li Qiye was not bad.</p><p>Chen Baojiao was a supreme beauty with features capable of toppling cities and countries. The moment her white eyes become exposed, they were fascinatingly soul stealing.</p><p>“Miss Chen, this is playing with fire. You shouldn’t throw your beautiful gazes carelessly. Even though I am a gentleman, I cannot guarantee to maintain my calm with you sitting in my lap.”<span style="font-size: 13.3333px">[1.&nbsp;Made one change here. Playing with fire was originally “seeking death” – not making as much sense in English. Second line is just an expression praising her beauty in a perverted way]</span></p><p>Li Qiye leisurely smiled and spoke.</p><p>Li Qiye’s words made Chen Baojiao blush with anger. She could only coldly scowl, and she left with a cold expression without saying another word.</p><p>Li Qiye’s arrogant demeanor rendered Dao Child Shengtian’s expression to become extremely ugly. He chillingly glared at Li Qiye and said:</p><p>“My wife already has my protection and doesn’t need the help of others.”</p><p>One has to know that the Jade Valley Country and the Heavenly God Sect has an arranged marriage, and Chen Baojiao will be married to Dao Child Shengtian. Even though the ceremony had not taken place, she was already considered the fiancé of Dao Child Shengtian.</p><p>At this moment, when Li Qiye was teasing his fiancé in front of everyone, even a statue would become angry, let alone Dao Child Shengtian — this heaven’s proud son.</p><p>“Who is your wife!”</p><p>Chen Baojiao coldly said.</p><p>She was extremely against this marriage, but her fate was not up to her to decide.</p><p>Dao Child Shengtian’s eyes became fierce. He suddenly exuded his aura and imposingly said:</p><p>“Baojiao, now is not the time to be capricious. Otherwise, I will personally take you back!”</p><p>“Surname Long, who do you think you are!”<span style="font-size: 13.3333px">[2.&nbsp;She literally said Surname&nbsp;Long – Long is his surname. It is just an expression of anger when calling someone out by calling their&nbsp;surname]</span></p><p>Chen Baojiao coldly said as her expression soured.</p><p>Dao Child Shengtian’s aura covered the heavens with the presence of a Royal Noble. In a flash, he became an unreachable king. He stared intensely at Chen Baojiao and said:</p><p>“As a married woman, you need have the virtues of a married woman!”</p><p>Chen Baojiao held her wrath. She raised her Life Treasure and coldly shouted:</p><p>“Surname&nbsp;Long, do you think this Chen Baojiao is afraid of you…”</p><p>“Aii! Miss Chen. Since it is like this, I am very willing to help.”</p><p>Li Qiye calmly smiled and said:</p><p>“You don’t want to marry the little demon of the Heavenly God Sect. This is very easy to arrange. Simply say the words and I will slay him for you!”</p><p>Li Qiye’s words silenced everyone currently present. Dao Child Shengtian was clearly older than Li Qiye, yet he called him a little demon. What was even more ridiculous was that he was robbing someone’s fiancé right in front of him. It would be strange if they didn’t become crazy.</p><p>Dao Child Shengtian’s face turned pale blue. He took a step forward, and then said:</p><p>“Little demon, you are seeking your death today!”</p><p>Immediately, his blood energy was like the ocean, and he headed towards Li Qiye’s direction.</p><p>“You’re only a Royal Noble, yet you’re still arrogantly playing in front of me?”</p><p>Li Qiye glared at him. He didn’t move at all, and then said:</p><p>“Shuangyan, he wants to fight, so entertain and kill him for me. Today, I am in a good mood and I don’t want to stain my hands with blood.”</p><p>Li Shuangyan stood up like a holy lotus that was blooming. In a flash, her body was surrounded by a sacred light. Like a descending fairy, she was pure without imperfections and impervious to all existences!</p><p>Without a doubt, after being in the Evil Infested Ridge for so long, her Void Imperfection Physique had increased by a level!</p><p>Li Shuangyan activated her Physique, which was already astonishing, but her Royal Noble aura also penetrated the sky. In a flash, the invincible power of the king wound around the world. She was like a master of a nation, capable of shouldering the absolute power!</p><p>Li Shuangyan’s Royal Noble presence swept through the planes, causing everyone to be surprised. Such a powerful Royal Noble aura… It was even stronger than Dao Child Shengtian.</p><p>Seeing her Royal Noble aura punishing the heavens — unstoppable by anything, it caused Dao Child Shengtian’s expression to sink!</p><p>Li Qiye glanced at him and deliberately teased:</p><p>“With just this much yet you dared to be arrogant in front of me! Aren’t you a genius? What is the big deal? Compared to my Shuangyan, you are so far behind! My Shuangyan, with her Saint Fate and King Physique, isn’t a bit arrogant. You are only a Saint Fate — arrogant my ass!”</p><p>Li Qiye poured oil into the burning fire and immediately made Dao Child Shengtian livid with anger!</p><p>Even though Li Qiye was harsh, it still moved many people. In the end, Li Shuangyan’s talents were right there; she had a Saint Fate and King Physique, and even a King Wheel. With such innate talents, she would be a peerless genius no matter which sect or heritage she was placed in!</p><p>She was such a genius, yet she had to follow a man who was a complete mortal. It made everyone feel a sense of injustice for her.</p><p>Seeing Li Shuangyan and Dao Child Shengtian about to fight in such a tense atmosphere, Enlightened Being Si Tu, as the national teacher, quickly stood up to mediate:</p><p>“Goddess Li, why are we all fighting with the sword? The treasure of the gods is right in front of us, everyone should be combining forces in order to seize the treasure! We haven’t even seen the treasure yet we are already fighting, isn’t this a laughable matter? Take a step back and be humbled by the high sky and vast ocean, am I right?”</p><p>The Enlightened Being was a sly fox; he had lived for so long that he had become a demon. He noticed that Li Shuangyan, alone, was enough to make others wary, and the rumors even said that Li Qiye had an Emperor Treasure on his body. Regardless of whether this was true or not, he didn’t hope to see them fight to the bitter end before even seeing the treasure. This was not worth the venture.</p><p>Enlightened Being Si Tu advised Dao Child Shengtian, and Li Shuangyan realized that there wouldn’t be a fight, so she backed off to Li Qiye’s side.</p><p>At this time, everyone had a different expression: envy, jealousy, disdain, and injustice…</p><p>Li Shuangyan, with her origin and talents as well as peerless appearance, was betrothed to a disciple of the declining Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect with such low talents. This was truly a beautiful flower surrounded by a pile of cow dung. In the eyes of many, Li Shuangyan was destroying her own future.</p><p>There were countless suitors and fans, amongst the younger generation, throughout the Grand Middle Territory who adored Li Shuangyan, yet she had to be married to a bag of straws. Countless geniuses’ hearts were broken, and their eyes reddened with jealousy!</p><p>“We shall go…”</p><p>Finally, Dao Child Shengtian, who was boiling with anger, threw out those words and jumped inside the crater with his Royal Nobles, disappearing in the darkness.</p><p>“Go…”</p><p>Heavenly Prince Qingxuan also jumped in right after him for the Godly Monarch weapon.</p><p>In reality, these people had been observing this crater for a long time. Heavenly Prince Qingxuan and Dao Child Shengtian opened their Heavenly Gazes to look at the situation beneath, and they felt a bit in control of the situation.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry, I heard the treasure of the gods is right at the bottom.”</p><p>Seeing the two giants leaving, the other great sects and powerful nations also followed suit. Suddenly, the cultivators everywhere started to jump down, like dumplings into a pot.</p><p>Li Qiye narrowed his eyes. He saw that Chen Baojiao still hadn’t left, so he started a conversation:</p><p>“Miss Chen, how about we talk for a little bit?”</p><p>“We have nothing to talk about!”</p><p>Chen Baojiao coldly glanced at Li Qiye. At this moment, in her angry eyes, Li Qiye was no different from a womanizer.</p><p>“Miss Chen is greatly misunderstanding something.”</p><p>Li Qiye leisurely said:</p><p>“Even though I must have Miss Chen, it is not for your beauty. I am short of a maid by my side, so I will leave a spot for Miss Chen.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Chen Baojiao suddenly turned red and glared at Li Qiye. She was very angry. At the end of the day, she came from the Jewel Pillar Sacred School, but to become his maid… This was too insulting!</p><p>“Little Man, if you keep talking, I will rip your mouth off!”</p><p>Finally, Chen Baojiao bitterly said.</p><p>Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind. He was still nonchalant and continued to speak:</p><p>“Staying by my side is your honor. Not only for you, but also for your Chen Clan!”</p><p>Finished speaking, he formed a mudra with his hands in front of his chest.<span style="font-size: 13.3333px">[3.&nbsp;Mudra is a symbolic hand gesture used in Hindu and Buddhist ceremonies and statuary, and in Indian dance]</span></p><p>Even though Chen Baojiao was furious, her eyes spewed out fiery animosity, and she wanted to tear Li Qiye’s mouth apart, but after seeing Li Qiye’s mudra, she became shocked and stared at Li Qiye in astonishment!</p><p>“You, what are you!”</p><p>The charming and alluring eyes of Chen Baojiao became frightened as she was looking at Li Qiye.</p><p>“What do you think, Miss Chen?”</p><p>Li Qiye leisurely said as he sustained his mudra in front of his chest.</p><p>This time, Chen Baojiao clearly saw the mudra without any doubts. She became emotional. This was the secret mudra of her Chen Clan, an outsider wouldn’t know of this!</p><p>“We’ll talk a little bit.”</p><p>Li Qiye gave a wide smile to Chen Baojiao.</p><p>Chen Baojiao took a quick glance at the old man controlling her carriage, then she nodded her head:</p><p>“Fine!”</p><p>The mudra left her stunned since it was a secret exclusive to her clan.</p><p>Li Qiye looked at the bottomless crater once, then he smiled. He was not in a rush. He turned around and left.</p><p>Li Qiye brought Chen Baojiao to a safe place without anyone else. He then glanced at the old man following behind her and said:</p><p>“I will speak privately with Miss Chen, alright?”</p><p>The old man looked at Chen Baojiao, and she slightly nodded her head. Then, she said:</p><p>“Grandpa Shi, it is fine, you can take a break.”</p><p>The old man didn’t say anything and quietly receded. Li Shuangyan and Niu Fen also left without being told by Li Qiye.</p><p>“Good, now you can talk.”</p><p>At this moment, Chen Baojiao looked at Li Qiye. His knowledge of the mudra was too shocking to her.</p><p>Li Qiye motioned his finger and smiled:</p><p>“Come here, I will tell you a secret.”</p><p>Seeing Li Qiye’s secretive demeanor, Chen Baojiao’s curiosity was piqued. She couldn’t help but inch closer with her head.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
