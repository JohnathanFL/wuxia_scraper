Many great powers watching from their mirror couldn’t figure out his identity at all despite concerted effort.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Driedtree Divine Ancestor!” Finally, the oldest ancestor from an imperial lineage exclaimed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is that?” The juniors quickly asked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An invincible character from my generation.” The ancestor said: “Rumor has it that he is a withered ancestral tree coming back to life and has the previous memories of the treefather.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this, the juniors gasped. One of them asked: “Isn’t that the same as a treefather coming back to life?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s just a rumor, who knows?” The ancestor murmured: “It’s a pity that he was only one step away from being a treefather back in my time, I don’t know why he failed in the end though.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, more ancestors recognized him through the heavenly mirrors. They naturally became shocked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dualchild was indeed amazing with many connections. In just a short period, he was able to drag out another heavyweight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like he has said in the past towards Li Qiye, if he were to become Li Qiye’s dao protector, he would offer him other advantages in the form of resources and connections. It looked like he wasn’t only boasting today.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it wasn’t too strange. After all, he was a child between an emperor and a treemother. Due to his prestigious background, the unstoppable Era Evaders from that age probably had some relationships with him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Still missing one.” Li Qiye still didn’t care on his throne. He didn’t even bother looking at Driedtree.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driedtree’s eyes turned cold from this aloof act with glittering starlights. They illuminated the entire world. However, he quickly converged them and assumed his calm demeanor afterwards.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” After Li Qiye finished speaking, a wave rushed to the nine heavens. A gigantic ship entered the vast sea and set off a vast tsunami.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Roaring Conch. It traveled through the sea just like a large drifting continent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One person stepped out to the deck. It was Ling Fengyun. Each of his step was an entire world or an ocean.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His pace was so leisure just like a stroll. It didn’t look like he was entering a battle at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The winds and clouds moved with his step. The world was shocked; the sun and moon made way for him while the stars tilted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could feel Heaven Spirit shaking as he walked towards the Broken God Cliff. He didn’t seem to be moving, the Broken God Cliff was moving towards him instead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This illusion made many experts watching him dizzy and didn’t dare to look any further.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Fengyun is too strong.” One ancestor was convinced by his strength. Just his step alone was enough to daze many people, causing some to fall flat on the ground. Once he actually took action, wouldn’t he be able to slaughter everyone instantly?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Roaring Conch was following right behind him. It wasn’t only capable of floating in the ocean but could fly freely as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its monstrous size didn’t hinder its crazy speed at all. If it was considered a flying treasure, it would be among the top ten in terms of speed in all of Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Fengyun made it to the cliff, the conch finally stopped with some distance in between to watch.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The conch wants to let everyone in the world know their position and that Ling Fengyun is their backing. This is another attempt to establish their prestige.” The older generation naturally understood why the Roaring Conch also came.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the death of the Conch Overlord was a great blow to their sect. They must do something about their reputation or many great powers would start to covet and even divide their territories.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world became quiet with Fengyun’s arrival. In a jiffy, the six invincible existences formed a pincer to surround Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Mengtian, Stygian Monarch, Imperial Dualchild, Driedtree Divine Ancestor, Creek Bamboo Immortal and Ling Fengyun. The six of them circled around the cliff like deities. They resembled uncrossable demonic mountains or unsurpassable lightning ponds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless cultivators held their breath in Heaven Spirit. Everyone understood that regardless of the victor, the direction and fate of Heaven Spirit would be changed completely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another group was hiding right outside of the cliff. These faint figures were hiding all of their auras and blood energy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts capable of watching in person were the real deal. Only a personal viewing would be fruitful for this great battle. This was the way to understand each techniques’ power and the slight transformations!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, they were the strongest characters in Heaven Spirit. Godking was only the entry level in this place. In order to truly feel the profundity of this battle and learn from it, one needed to be an Apex Godking at the very least.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before reaching this level, it was impossible to learn just from watching the fight. Of course, the cultivators below this level wouldn’t even be able to see the attacks themselves, let alone understanding the little intricacies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most dust-ladened ancestors wouldn’t come out so easily but a battle of this level was exceedingly rare. A few of them couldn’t help coming out to watch in person.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On top of the cliff, the combatants’ gaze was fixated on Li Qiye. Despite not attacking just yet, just their glares were frightening enough with supreme pressure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone else would have pissed in their pants being the target of so many masters. However, Li Qiye was still nonchalant as ever on his chariot and continued to look at the clouds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only sounds left in Heaven Spirit were heartbeats. Even the winds, waves, and time itself seemed to have stopped.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, one can’t help but admire your courage. At the very least, when I was young like you, I wasn’t so domineering.” Ling Fengyun commented while staring at Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is not courage.” Li Qiye casually responded: “In my eyes, all of you are no different from dead men. Why should I be afraid of some small potatoes?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His opponents certainly didn’t like this comment. Murderous intents rose from their eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts watching from the mirror could only smile wryly. It was not like he has only started this arrogant act recently. Those who knew him understood that this was his style regardless of who he was facing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Fengyun actually laughed in response without becoming angry: “Impressive, the future generation will surpass us. You can’t be blamed for being so arrogant due to your achievements in spite of your age. Unfortunately, you are only missing a bit of finesse and wisdom. A wise person would have chosen differently.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled in response: “I actually want to hear what kind of choice a wise person would make instead.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fengyun looked at him and replied: “In all of history, you might be the only one who has cultivated thirteen palaces. If you could have avoided today, the throne is certainly yours for the taking. I am someone who can appreciate talents and have no ill wills towards you. However, you have killed people from the Roaring Conch so you should have given them a reasonable answer.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled: “Is that so? Sounds like you are willing to make peace.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fengyun responded: “Not to that level. However, seeing your supreme achievements and domineering courage truly moved me. It is a shame that such a peerless genius will have to fall today. A person like you should become an emperor for Heaven Spirit instead of dying like this.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such shift of attitude caught everyone off guard, especially the experts sitting in front of their mirrors.</span></p>
