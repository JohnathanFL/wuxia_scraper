<p><b>Chapter 476: Imp Qin Guangwang</b></p><p>After being shrouded in the divine light, Qiurong Wanxue finally heaved a sigh of relief and no longer felt the suppressive aura.</p><p>Imp madly roared and unleashed countless magical runes to attack the barrier at the gate. A very small hole was created in this barrier.</p><p>In a split second, Imp used an unbelievable speed to rush towards the gate in order to enter the temple.</p><p>However… “Boom!” A deafening blast threatened to destroy the heaven and earth. The moment Imp tried to infiltrate the temple via this tiny gap, the barrier blocked his path. Even in his mighty “god of war” form, he was still blown away by the barrier of light. His invincibility could neither stop nor withstand the barrier’s power.</p><p>It was an eye-catching scene to see Imp flying in the sky as his white beard became stained with his own blood. He fell heavily to the ground as blood spattered everywhere. After a long time, he finally managed to get up.</p><p>He sat straight down on the ground with a pale expression. His dimmed eyes made it apparent that he was without any will to fight.</p><p>“You still can’t do it.” Li Qiye approached and shook his head to say: “Everyone is powerless in the face of this matter. One can only rely on oneself when dealing with a heavenly tribulation like this. If outsiders could help, then it would have happened already.”</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue didn’t understand what Li Qiye was talking about and only stood silently to the side.</p><p>The frozen Imp finally looked up and said: “I have prepared for a very long time just for today.”</p><p>“It is meaningless.” Li Qiye shook his head and continued: “If it could work, then would the Ancestral Flow Master just sit there and wait? If outsiders could help, then it would already have been dealt with.”</p><p>“Who are you?” Imp gazed intensely at Li Qiye and asked with a deep tone. Imp’s eyes focused; this was a pair of eyes as bright as the stars. With an unparalleled prestige, they caused others to want to submit.</p><p>Li Qiye was unfazed by the gaze and replied: “Who I am is not important. However, I will give you a chance, maybe you will find salvation.”</p><p>The stunned Imp came back to life and shook his head to say: “Salvation? I should have been saved in the past but… but…” Imp let out a soft sigh.</p><p>Li Qiye said with a smile: “The ancient legends have always been a mystery and included many complex things. That year, even if you tried your best, it wouldn’t have done anything.”</p><p>Imp had a smile filled with bitterness, regret, and helplessness; this one smile contained too many emotions.</p><p>Li Qiye consoled: “I heard that you used your blood for the sacrificial ceremony that year. You have already tried your best.”</p><p>Imp shook his head and bitterly laughed. After a long time, Imp responded: “No, it was to ask for forgiveness.”</p><p>“No need to be discouraged, there is still a chance. For example, me!” Li Qiye looked at him and said while pointing at his own nose: “If you agree to help me, then no matter if it is for salvation or forgiveness, there will be a chance.”</p><p>“What kind of chance?” Imp gravely inquired.</p><p>Li Qiye pointed at the sky and declared: “I want to declare war, I want to tear that sky apart, I want to penetrate that damn place, I want to dig out that damned existence, I want to dispel the fog that’s shrouding all things!”</p><p>“Declare war? Haha… Ha... “ Imp burst out in laughter as if he had just heard the funniest thing in the world.</p><p>“With just you? Hahaha…” Imp was tearing up from laughter while pointing at Li Qiye. He laughed to the point where he could no longer stand straight.</p><p>“It seems that you don’t believe me.” Li Qiye didn’t care for his laughter and leisurely said.</p><p>Imp struggled to stop laughing and shook his head to say: “I’m not looking down on you. It’s just that wanting to tear that sky apart... Not even Immortal Emperors would be able to do it, let alone you.”</p><p>Li Qiye retorted: “It isn’t necessarily impossible for an Immortal Emperor; it depends on whether they have the courage to fight or not. Don’t forget that, in the past, Immortal Emperor Fei Yang had fought to the point where the heavens collapsed while both devils and gods cried out. Eventually, he suppressed that place completely.”</p><p>“Even Immortal Emperor Fei Yang would not be able to tear that sky apart.” Imp shook his head and said: “Although he was there for a very long time, he still couldn’t tear apart that damned area!”</p><p>“Because this is an issue of your ghost race. It was only a challenge to Immortal Emperor Fei Yang. Suppressing that place for one generation was already enough.”</p><p>“What about you?” Imp looked at Li Qiye and probed: “You are also a human so this place has nothing to do with you.”</p><p>Li Qiye narrowed his eyes and smiled after a long silence: “Not necessarily. I might be a human, but there are a few things I want to make clear.”</p><p>“Commendable courage, but you won’t do.” Imp shook his head and said.</p><p>“Is that so?” Li Qiye smilingly refuted: “I don’t think so. Although my cultivation right now is far from an Immortal Emperor, my methods are definitely no weaker than one. More importantly, I have something that Immortal Emperors do not have. For example… this thing!”</p><p>Li Qiye took out a tree stump with the shape of an open palm from his Fate Palace. The already-dead stump had green leaves growing from it — filled with endless life.</p><p>Imp took several steps back as if he had seen a ghost and exclaimed in astonishment: “No… No way!”</p><p>Imp was at a loss for words. After some time, he pointed at Li Qiye and uttered in surprise: “How… did this thing fall into your possession?”</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and withdrew his palace before saying: “It doesn’t matter how I obtained it. The important thing is whether you are interested or not.”</p><p>Imp was dazed and unable to speak.</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and continued: “I understand. This is a path towards death. You can think about it and give me an answer later. Of course, don’t let me wait for too long.”</p><p>Imp looked at Li Qiye; one wouldn’t know what he was thinking about.</p><p>After a very long time, he took a deep breath and asked: “What do you want me to do?”</p><p>Li Qiye replied: “I need someone to open a path for me. With you as my vanguard, I can accomplish even more things.”</p><p>“With just me?” Imp shook his head and said: “I alone won’t do. It is not because I’m afraid of death; death to me is salvation. However, with only me helping you, it would be absolutely helpless and we would not be able to attack that place. That damned place is too powerful and is definitely not weaker than any burial ground!” [1. Burial ground such as the Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground back at the Mortal Emperor World; the Prime Ominous Grave might be one as well.]</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and said: “I understand this so I naturally have a solution. You just need to open the way and deal with certain things. As for the ultimate battle, leave it to me; I shall tear that place apart!”</p><p>Imp was stunned and was met by more words from Li Qiye: “Of course, you should be mentally prepared. Once we make our way in, I cannot guarantee your survival. You should already know as well that leaving Necropolis is not easy.”</p><p>“Survival? If we make it there, I do not plan on coming back alive.” Imp gently sighed: “I am neither a man nor ghost… Continuing to live is meaningless. If His Excellency didn’t grant me this supreme blessing, then I wouldn’t want to live any longer after that blood ceremony in Necropolis in the past.”</p><p>Li Qiye nodded his head and said: “Very well, you shall be my vanguard. It will be very spectacular.”</p><p>Imp took Li Qiye’s hand and agreed: “Good, I hope you will be successful. My name is Qin Guangwang, I have not used this name for a long time.”</p><p>“I know.” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “You probably have never heard of my name before. It is Li Qiye.”</p><p>Qin Guangwang murmured his name again and again. Then he looked up at Li Qiye: “I seemed to have heard of this name before.”</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and looked back at the ancient temple: “Then I shall get started.”</p><p>“What do you want to do?” The puzzled Qin Guangwang asked.</p><p>Li Qiye replied: “Don’t worry, I won’t do anything crazy. I only came here to look at a few things. Also, I’m here to borrow a certain item.”</p><p>“Borrow?” Qin Guangwang was confused. He couldn’t help but look at Li Qiye then back at the ancient temple before he suddenly seemed to have realized something.</p><p>Li Qiye stepped towards the ancient temple, quickly followed by Qiurong Wanxue. She didn’t understand what they were talking about, but she didn’t ask either. If Li Qiye wanted to talk, then he would definitely tell her.</p><p>Li Qiye stood before the gate and slowly took out a box with many seals on it. He raised the box with both hands while bearing a very solemn expression.</p><p>“This item…” Qin Guangwang was quite shocked. He clearly knew what this box contained.</p><p>“I borrowed it.” Li Qiye smiled then took a deep breath. Afterward, he closed his eyes and opened his Fate Palace, then the wooden stump appeared in his hand.</p><p>Li Qiye seemed to be praying: “I will declare war against the heavens and tear apart this fog. I fight to solve the mysteries so I need that certain item. Today, I am here to sincerely pray and hope that you will lend it to me. I heard that the legendary battle armor is here. Today, I want to borrow it and I shall return once I become victorious!”</p><p>After praying, Li Qiye slowly opened the box. A light flashed before disappearing inside the ancient temple, then he closed the cover.</p><p>Meanwhile, the green leaves on the tree stump exuded a verdant radiance as waves of light that were seemingly alive flowed into Li Qiye’s body, giving him a boundless vitality.</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue and Qin Guangwang held their breaths while gazing at the sky inside the ancient temple.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>[spoiler title='476 Teaser'][caption id="" align="alignnone" width="600"]<img height="878" src="http://orig11.deviantart.net/0caa/f/2011/208/8/2/the_smile_of_a_dying_old_man_by_witchofwest-d41ug5c.jpg" class="size-full" width="600"> Hopelessness[/caption][/spoiler]</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
