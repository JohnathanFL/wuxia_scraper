It was as if nothing could hinder his steps.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master of Qingcheng, what is your decision?” Aotian spoke calmly in the air. Each word rang sonorously like a gong in everyone’s mind, instilling fear into them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-d88a"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greetings, Imperial Prince Long, the pleasure is mine. Please advise.” The sect master had to step out and cupped his fist together.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-d88a">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have no advice to give, my demand is very simple. Hand over Hai Lin and the four-clawed dragon then I’ll leave immediately without troubling your sect.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one found such aggressive words out of place. They felt like Aotian should speak in such an imperious manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd knew that it was unwise to become enemy with Aotian just for Hai Lin’s sake. Anyone else should know the right choice easily.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master glanced at Hai Lin who was being healed and said with a deep tone: “Imperial prince, Young Noble Hai Lin has deep ties with our sect. We don’t dare to comment on your grievances but we must save him. You are a benevolent person, how about come back later to deal with him after his wounds are healed?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master’s words were craftily chosen even against an overwhelming force. His opponent would find it difficult to refute or take action.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid it’s not up to your sect at all.” Aotian said with a sneer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mount Qingcheng was a very powerful sect in the Grand Sea. Even though it wasn’t an imperial lineage, it still had a peerless Godking like Ding Yuanhou. Not too many would dare to act blazenly against this sect. But Aotian didn’t place them in his eyes at all. Even the disciples from Qingcheng didn’t dare to retort. They knew just how powerful their foe was and his terrible lineage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Imperial prince, leave a way out. Wait until Hai Lin is cured before trying to finish it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No.” Aotian refused instantly in a cold manner: “Sect master, you only have two choices. Either hand the two of them over or wait for sect destruction!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people felt suffocated after this declaration. They knew that he wasn’t all talk. With his power on top of his sect, it was absolutely possible.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone glanced over at the sect master and wondered what he would choose. They understood that opposing Soaring Immortal was unwise but some still had hopes about someone standing up against that sect. After all, ever since their arrival, they have been too aggressive. Perhaps their goal was to even rule the entire Grand Sea eventually. Many didn’t wish to see this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master glanced at the immobilized Hai Lin again. In the end, he sighed and said: “Imperial prince, if you want his life, our sect will have to take you on. He is our guest so we shall protect him.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts in the vicinity were shocked to hear this. Many became excited about this non-imperial sect daring to stand up against Long Aotian!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very well, impressive decisiveness. Then I’ll see how long your sect can hold out!” Aotian laughed and instantly stomped down on the sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” The entire mountain range shook before this stomp. It resembled a tiny boat ravaged by the torrential sea that could go down at any moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts here became anxious at the impending doom.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Time for battle, defend your positions!” The sect master shouted with a grave expression.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he finished giving the order, their defensive perimeter was broken by Long Aotian. Bright pieces of light faltered everywhere!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This barrier has been built for many generations and empowered by a large quantity&nbsp;of refined jades but it didn’t manage to last long at all against Aotian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Charge!” The experts and disciples here roared for battle. They unsheathed their weapons and channeled their blood energy, pointing their rage at Aotian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff!” Aotian instantly jumped into the sect with agility beyond comprehension. One could only see his fleeting figure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff!” Next, one pillar of blood gushed after another. The blood energy exuded from the disciples here were suddenly extinguished.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang, bang, bang!” The sound of head meeting the ground finally came about.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene of the guards dying was too shocking. Blood gushed out of their severed neck like the spring and turned into a rain of bloody flowers. In the end, these experts fell onto the ground. Their head still had some consciousness left and could see their own headless body!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aotian had speed virtually too fast to discern. In the blink of an eye, the experts here were decapitated without a chance to fight back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So weak yet still dare to oppose me?” He sneered proudly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene scared many spectators. This great speed allowed him to be a reaper. Even stronger people would lose their head against such speed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mount Qingcheng became defenseless after this quick massacre to the dismay of the pale sect master. Even so many experts failed to stop a single move from Long Aotian. The guy was indeed unstoppable!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Aotian stared at the sect master and smiled: “Sect master, this is all your sect can do? That’s too disappointing then. You all must really look down on me to oppose me with such meager power.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Prepare the formation.” The sect master and seventeen other experts from his same generation instantly lined up. The entire mountain lit up with rays of light.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” Under the ultimate light of this formation, the entire mountain seemed like a starry ocean with floating stars and galaxies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great formation presided over the mountain range like the Big Dipper. Its majestic aura emanated and amplified the mountain’s presence as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts suddenly became excited. The killing earlier drowned them in despair but this formation, on the other hand, showed them a sliver of hope!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Dipper’s Eighteen Children. This is Mount Qingcheng’s ultimate move!” One expert that knew about the sect had to say: “They’re the strongest disciples under Ding Yuanhou who have learned all of his skills.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Aotian didn’t give a damn. He laughed in response: “This formation might be derived from an ancient holy formation but your sect’s version has too many flaws. It won’t be able to block a single blow.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts shuddered after hearing this. People in the Grand Sea were aware that this formation was exceedingly powerful, especially when the eighteen children were performing it themselves. But now, Aotian said that it wouldn’t amount to anything. Just how powerful was he?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mount Qingcheng didn’t respond to this arrogance. The entire sect was under the protection of this supreme formation in total tranquility.</span></p><div id="footnote-d88a"><p>1.
