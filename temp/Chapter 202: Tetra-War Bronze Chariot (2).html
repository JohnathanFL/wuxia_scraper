<p><b>Chapter 202: Tetra-War Bronze Chariot (2)</b></p><p>Jikong Jian’s blood violently sprayed everywhere. Li Qiye’s sword chopped the treasure box fueled by Jikong Jian’s blood energy, thus he suffered as well while his body flew outside, carrying its broken bones.</p><p>“Zhang...” The Six Dao Sword flew out and a loud scream resounded as Jikong Jian was pinned in the sky by the sword; his blood painted the sky itself!</p><p>“Ah…” At the same time, Niu Fen also rampaged through the battlefield without hiding his strength as his tentacles swept across and devoured hundreds of Heavenly God Sect experts. His hand also stretched across the air and ripped apart Wan Shengjian’s hand from his body.</p><p>This scene shocked many people for Wan Shengjian was a Grand Saint at grand accomplishment with one foot into the Heavenly Sovereign realm! One has to know that without Heavenly Kings, Heavenly Sovereigns could rule over all existences! But at this moment, he was being ripped apart by this snail!</p><p>With Jikong Jian nailed to the sky by Li Qiye’s one sword, everyone drew a cold breath as they glanced at the person next to them. This guy had not reached the Royal Noble realm and was not even a Royal Noble, so why was he so perplexingly powerful like this?</p><p>At this time, the eyes of young geniuses, such as Young King Nantian, Jewel Pillar Saint Child, and even Bai Jianzhen, shimmered. It was not strange for Li Shuangyan to be unrivaled as a genius, but everyone knew Li Qiye was a Mortal Fate, Mortal Physique, and Mortal Wheel!</p><p>Jewel Pillar Saint Child’s deep eyes hid his emotions, but his heart was shivering. He knew Li Qiye’s Physique was amazing and he suspected that Li Qiye was cultivating an Immortal Physique. However, he was not so sure about it. But if this was the truth, then it would be a great threat to him!</p><p>As for Young King Nantian, his eyes coldly glinted while carrying a solemn expression. His cousin, Nantian Hao, died to the hands of Li Qiye! His murderous intent became even stronger today after seeing Li Qiye; Li Qiye would surely be a great enemy to him if Li Qiye didn’t get nipped as a bud.</p><p>As for Bai Jianzhen, the descendant of the Sword God Sacred Ground, her sword intent was surging all the way to the sky. When it came to the sword, the sacred ground had always been number one. However, after seeing Li Qiye’s slash, she was excited to try as well.</p><p>Li Qiye strided forward and looked at the pinned Jikong Jian in the sky and spoke in an unruffled manner: “You only had one Emperor’s Possession and one godly saber, yet you still dared to be arrogant! Bring an Emperor’s weapon here if you want to play with me! Without an Emperor’s weapon, you are bringing about your own destruction!”</p><p>“Kid, I am a Space Trample Mountain disciple! If you dare to even touch a hair of mine, we will surely destroy your Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!” Being nailed in the sky with his blood staining the horizon, Jikong Jian’s life was hanging on a thread. However, he still sternly shouted.</p><p>“Space Trample Mountain?” Li Qiye smiled and stomped down, resulting in a scream along with the cracking sounds of broken bones, sending chills to all the listeners.</p><p>“Stop…!” Qing Xuan Yuanhe finally couldn’t idly sit by any longer and lightly shouted. The chariot’s refined jades lit up and the chariot immediately flew forward!</p><p>By this time, the battlefield was not looking good as cries and shrieks resounded everywhere. The Nine Saint Demon Gate had begun to reverse its losing swing, especially after the Heavenly God Sect lost their main vanguards — Dao Child Sheng Tian and Wan Shengjian. The overarching situation became increasingly disadvantageous for the Heavenly God Sect.</p><p>Qing Xuan Yuanhe immediately went looking for Li Qiye, then he demanded: “Junior, let go of Nephew Ji and I will spare your life!”</p><p>Qing Xuan Yuanhe immediately taking action rendered the spectating crowd breathless. To many people, Li Shuangyan was a genius, but she was not at the level where she could shake Ancient Kingdoms. Everyone would have to give Qing Xuan Yuanhe some face since he represented the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom.</p><p>The Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom was a sect with two emperors. If they interfered, who dared not to give them face? Both the Heavenly God Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate were not comparable to the Ancient Kingdom.</p><p>“What are you!” Li Qiye didn’t bother to glance at him. Finished speaking, the Six Dao Sword cut Jikong Jian in half with a “zhang.” With a pitiful “ahh,” Jikong Jian was slashed in half. His skull was split open so even if his body was restored, he would not be able to live for much longer.</p><p>“You…” Qing Xuan Yuanhe was too late to the rescue. Li Qiye’s sword was too fast and even he didn’t expect that this kid wouldn’t give him any face.</p><p>Many spectators were stunned with their eyes wide open. Such murderous determination! Not leaving any face for Qing Xuan Yuanhe. This was an expert from the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, the brother of Mortal King Qing Xuan!</p><p>Many audacious geniuses were always arrogant, but at this moment, when they stood in front of a giant monster such as the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, they had to think twice about becoming its enemy.</p><p>Yet this fifteen or sixteen year old boy before them was true to his words: “What are you!” He essentially didn’t put the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom into his sight with his level of unbridled haughtiness.</p><p>“Kid, since you want to die, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Qing Xuan Yuanhe instantly became angry, and following his rising Saint aura, he shouted. A group of Fate Palaces emerged with its boundless domain soaring straight towards Li Qiye — they aimed to pull him inside.</p><p>“A Heaven Restoration Saint’s five palace domain would even refine a Grand Saint once they're trapped inside!” Many people couldn’t help but gasp.</p><p>“This kid is dead for sure. Even Grand Saints cannot escape from a Heaven Restoration Saint’s domain.” A sect master murmured.</p><p>“Be careful...” Seeing the five palace domain, Li Shuangyan’s group immediately reminded Li Qiye in astonishment.</p><p>“Xshhhh.” At this juncture of life and death, Li Qiye suddenly whistled at a rapid pace. This sound contained many different and indiscernible musical rhythms and resounded at varying speeds.</p><p>“Neighh...” At this very moment, the cries of horses rang out. With a “boom,” the bronze horses charged forward. Qing Xuan Yuanhe, who was standing on top of the chariot, initially wanted to trap Li Qiye inside his domain, but at this time, his body was sent flying upward for more than a thousand miles. Even an Ancient Saint like him could not maintain his stability; he couldn’t stop the chariot from turning him over.</p><p>“Bang!” Qing Xuan Yuanhe was struggling as his body was shot up high. Even his techniques couldn’t steady his body. The bronze chariot’s lifting force was capable of overturning the heaven’s horizon and grand earth!</p><p>‘Bang--bang--bang…” Within just a blink of an eye, the bronze horse chariot that was originally sat on by Qing Xuan Yuanhe rushed over towards Li Qiye and stood right in front of him.</p><p>“Good little horses, good little horses!” Li Qiye gently patted the heads of the four bronze horses. Each of his pats contained mysterious arrangements. After each pat, a strange magical rune appeared on the heads of the horses! Eventually, Li Qiye stood by their side and whispered into their ears!</p><p>“Neigh---neigh---neighhh!” An unbelievable matter happened; the four bronze horses suddenly flared out their eyes as hissing sounds resonated. At this moment, the eyes of the four bronze horses became vibrant and vivid just like real-life ones.</p><p>What was even more incredible was that the four horses seemed to be alive and they used their heads to hug Li Qiye affectionately. It was as if they had met a loved one.</p><p>“Good little horses…” After lightly caressing the horses, Li Qiye jumped on the bronze chariot with one hand on the arm rail, then he said: “This is a supreme treasure yet you used refined jades for its activation — so ignorant!” Under a light tap from Li Qiye, cracking sounds reverberated. All of the engraved refined jades on the chariot fragmented into pieces and fell down!</p><p>“Boom!” Finally, the four bronze horses leapt into the sky, pulling along the bronze chariot with a thunderous noise. At this very moment, the True Dragon coiled over the empty sky and the Divine Phoenix soaringly followed. The White Tiger was crouching down and was silently observing while the Qilin was expanding on the dao.</p><p>The true appearance of the bronze chariot created a sweeping Emperor’s aura in the air in all of its towering tyranny. Different images began to appear as if an Immortal Emperor was departing on an adventure!</p><p>The chariot carried Li Qiye around in a circle before stopping. The four bronze horses trampled in the sky in high spirits with a momentum like a profound dragon soaring in the sky or a fierce tiger leaving its mountain — the feeling of a vast sea for the fishes to swim freely and a high sky for the birds to fly with liberty!</p><p>“Tetra-War Bronze Chariot…” Li Qiye murmured while gently stroking the bronze chariot with endless remembrance. At the same time, the bronze chariot seemed to have its own awareness and emitted pure sounds from Li Qiye’s touch.</p><p>The Tetra-War Bronze Chariot carried countless memories of Li Qiye as the Dark Crow for millions of years for it used to be his carriage. In many eras, the moment the Tetra-War Bronze Chariot appeared, the gods had to retreat and even existing Immortal Emperors had to greet him in person!</p><p>This chariot left Li Qiye with too many recollections. It followed his battles throughout the nine heavens and ten earths. It fought against gods and devils and even punished Immortal Emperors. Countless wars that eternally frightened the world were fought with him riding this bronze chariot!</p><p>It wasn’t until a long time later that, during the era of invincible Immortal Emperor Min Ren, he as the Dark Crow was quite unstable and hibernation was quickly approaching. Coincidentally, Immortal Emperor Min Ren adopted a daughter at this time!</p><p>This foster daughter had quite an origin. She was the daughter of a general below Immortal Emperor Min Ren. This general had followed Li Qiye and Min Ren into battle after battle. Especially during the last battle for the Heaven’s Will, he fought to the very bitter end and died in battle!</p><p>As the Dark Crow, he promised this general to train his descendants in the future. Alas, when the general’s daughter grew up, he was already near unconsciousness and was already starting his deep hibernation! Since he couldn’t train her personally, Li Qiye entrusted the daughter of this divine general to Immortal Emperor Min Ren and he gave his chariot — his symbol to her in order to show her status!</p><p>Immortal Emperor Min Ren then took her in as a daughter as well as a disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect! All the way until she passed away, this chariot that represented a supreme identity was also left behind at the sect.</p><p>Unfortunately, she did not pass down the method to ride this chariot so even though it was an unparalleled treasure, no one in the history of the sect was able to ride it to battle!</p><p>Later on, as time passed by, the world gradually began to forget that this chariot was the symbol for a supreme identity, and it finally fell into the hands of the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom!</p><p>All the people who saw this scene couldn’t help but get sent into a daze. This was the chariot of Qing Xuan Yuanhe ah, but now, the scene of Li Qiye acting like the master of this chariot rendered everyone in disbelief!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
