While surrounded by the shining stars, he gestured and said: “Imperial prince, go.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At their level, if they were to go all out, a sect like Qingcheng wouldn’t be able to withstand their power and would be turned to ashes immediately.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aotian stared at Yuanhou and instantly flashed into the sky as well. He laughed and said: “Yuanhou, take out your weapons. I will let you die with peace.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have no worthy weapon to show off so I will only be using my bare hands.” Yuanhou responded.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a very calculated move. Even if he took out a weapon, he wouldn’t gain any advantage since his foe was Long Aotian from Soaring Immortal. The guy had no lack of Immortal Emperor True Treasures. Aotian could just take out a random true treasure and that would be more than enough to deal with him</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was a no-weapon contest, then he would actually have a chance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Using an imperial weapon would look like I’m bullying your little sect.” Aotian laughed: “Fine, Ding Yuanhou, I will go barehand with you for a few rounds so that you will be utterly convinced with your defeat!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go for it.” Yuanhou didn’t back down and instantly grasped the celestials.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With loud explosions and his finger pointing, these large stars instantly rushed for Aotian from all directions and exploded on contact.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The exploding stars were resplendent. Even the sun in the sky paled in comparison.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the stars shattered and the beautiful lights disappeared, Aotian was still standing there. He was protected by the deities and none of the explosions could touch him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take this.” Aotian shouted and unleashed a draconic punch like a true dragon or a phoenix soaring to the sky. It dragged out the galaxies and shattered the fabric of time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dragon roar emanated from this tyrannical fist. Yuanhou instantly raised both hands to create a long string of yin and yang laws that eventually turned into a tsunami to drown Aotian’s fist!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The draconic fist slammed into the dao tsunami with a deafening blast. An unstoppable power erupted and spread at an amazing speed. The debris in this area all turned to nothingness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the tsunami was destroyed, Yuanhou still managed to stop Long Aotian’s fist by dispelling all of its energy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have another!” Aotian pushed the sky back with another instantaneous palm strike. The six dao and reincarnation cycle were annihilated with his swift change from fist to palm. It was a flawless transformation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sky-pushing palm had an undodgeable speed. Even someone like Yuanhou couldn’t avoid this particular attack since he wasn’t faster than it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He roared and turned into a giant bull. Its cry could shatter the stars with hooves that could crush the galaxies and a pair of earth-piercing horns.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The horns stopped the palm attack but Yuanhou in his bull form still took several strides backward and shattered the stars.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People were shocked to see Aotian forcing Yuanhou to assume his true form after just several exchanges. Aotian was simply too strong.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawr!” While seeing that Yuanhou was at a disadvantage, the golden dragon jumped into the sky to stop Aotian’s retreat path.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bull and dragon&nbsp;surrounded Aotian in just a short moment. Yuanhou was powerful but he was still no match for Aotian. Aotian was young and vigorous on top of having all of his innate advantages. Yuanhou’s initial constitution and background were not a match against Aotian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Yuanhou was from an imperial lineage, perhaps there was a chance for him in a no-weapon contest. Alas, this was not the case.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine, I’ll deal with both of you together then.” Aotian wasn’t afraid at all by this pincer attack. He laughed with great confidence and didn’t bother using an imperial weapon at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those who viewed him as an enemy felt some admiration towards his great confidence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawr, Moo!” The two beasts unleashed their devastating attacks towards Aotian at the same time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bring it.” Aotian’s palms created an imperial law with a massive energy source like a deity. It swept through all evils easily.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three fought against each other and robbed the light of the sky. Not just anyone could watch this level of a fight, only those at the paragon level could understand it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The combined effort from the two beasts didn’t yield any result. Aotian was still leisure as ever while smoothly revealing his moves.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Godkings were shaken while watching this battle. As for the weaker crowd, they couldn’t look at what was happening above. Even if their seniors were to bring them up there, they wouldn’t have been able to understand the battle’s amazing profundities.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” During this moment, blaring noises came with a cavalry from the horizon. It rushed towards Mount Qingcheng and blocked off the entrance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Zhuo’s Demonic City!” The cultivators who have been watching the mountain range was shocked to see this cavalry.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Golden Dragon Prince is leading the troops himself.” One expert murmured.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince walked forward with cold, sweeping eyes on top of a brutal aura. His immense vitality was raging as if a golden dragon was wishing to come out of his body.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was very powerful at the Heavenly God realm on the path of the heavens. Only someone like him was qualified to be sworn brother with Long Aotian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, he had the confidence to reach the Heaven’s Will. Alas, once Long Aotian came out, he gave up this thought and decided to work under Aotian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince stared at the recovering Hai Lin before coldly speaking to the sect master: “Sect masters, smart people know when to give up. Hand over Hai Lin in order to avoid wails of lamentation and the fire of war destroying your sect!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was about the right attitude for someone as powerful at him. His words still enraged the demons in the crowd. Some demon monarchs even scowled in response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that the demonic city was one of the largest demon lineages in the Grand Sea. Meanwhile, Soaring Immortal was slaughtering the demons and sea monsters. Not only did the demonic city ignored the plight of their kins, they even assisted Soaring Immortal in the hunt. Such actions made many demons furious.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master shook his head and said: “Golden Dragon City Lord, I’m afraid I can’t obey.

The prince is already invincible even before becoming an emperor. Once he ascends, he’ll illuminate the world for an eternity. It doesn’t matter what backing you think you have, you are simply overestimating yourself. Provoking a future Immortal Emperor is suicidal!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Prince wasn’t only threatening Mount Qingcheng.
