Recently, after the king came out from isolated cultivation, she shocked the entire Mortal Emperor World with her unfathomable power. Many great powers in the Grand Sea were convinced by her and became friends with the cliff.”&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-b660">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sky Dragon King?

Some say that she is the strongest in the cliff so of course, her title is domineering. In the contemporary, she and the Heaven Suppression Goddess of the citadel are known as the two supreme geniuses of the Grand Sea.

Though the Wenren Clan was a mighty power compared to ordinary citizens and cultivators in Renowned, they were only a tiny sect compared to a behemoth like the Crouching Dragon Cliff.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Lurui’s constitution wasn’t bad but it was no match for real geniuses. Because of this, she knew that she would never become a character like the dragon king.

If Gu Zun tries to stop me, I’ll kill him mercilessly as usual. Don’t blame me for not being considerate. The city is also the culmination of your effort and mine as well, but if it tries to stop me too, it will turn into ashes. I won’t mind massacring them all!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His leisure eyes gazed towards the far distance and became quite profound and emotionless.

The act itself wouldn’t be difficult at all. However, the dragon king spent too much effort on this city. This was someone who had absolute loyalty and paid too much for him. This was the reason for his hesitation. Otherwise, he would have already taken charge of the city.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the afternoon, just like Lurui has said, Wenren Jianshi came again with two experts behind him this time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Li, father wishes to see you.” He was still very polite towards Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, as the saying goes, even an ugly daughter-in-law will have to meet her in-laws eventually.

This non-attribution of gender pronoun comes up a lot and some readers wonder why I do it in this manner. Usually, titles are gender neutral because I don’t know if it is a male or a female without context. So if I attribute english gender pronouns based on the character, it means that I have to do it consistently across the entire novel. In this case, when you see king for the first time, you will think its a male automatically. If the author decides to reveal that it is a woman later, I would have to go back and change every single pronoun, including he to she. As you can see, this will be very problematic. Another problem is that King is not interchangeable with Queen and Empress. Queen often implies being married to a king, not being in charge of her own country. Empress would work in this case, but the raw character is not on the same level as Empress. It looks like the title of Empress is special since it is reserved for Empress Hong Tian only. Also, this same ambiguation exists in the raw as well and could be used as a literary device. That’s why titles are gender neutral, not just because I’m lazy.<a href="#footnote-ref-b660"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p></div><div id="footnote-079b"><p>2.
