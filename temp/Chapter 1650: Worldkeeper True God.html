The five Legendary Godkings from Soaring Immortal have been slain in no time at all. Even Long Aotian with his grand completion physique lost after just one move. How terrifying was this character?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reason why everyone thought the newcomer was an emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the corner of their eyes was an old man with an austere expression. His face seemed to have been polished by time itself. In the end, nothing could ever change it again. Each feature and lines were clearly defined.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was riding a divine stallion. Despite being made from bronze, it was full of life and its muscles were animated. The old man didn’t have a frightening aura or a sky-engulfing vitality. He simply stood there in the sky and time seemed to have been frozen.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could ever get past him or even think about defeating him. He was the most fortified line of defense in the world. Nobody knew the origin of this old man, not even the most knowledgeable Godking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, your cultivation is not bad.” The old man looked at Long Aotian and said slowly: “Unfortunately, the only person who can fight me from your sect is Asura. The rest won’t be able to stop a single blow!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People listened attentively to each of his words. They didn’t know who <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Asura</span> was but this must be a terrifying character as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, how many would actually dare to make this statement? Even Long Aotian was aghast to hear this since he certainly knew who Asura was.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forefather Asura was once the strongest among their old ancestors. Some ancestors in his sect once said that outside of Immortal Emperors, if Forefather Asura wasn’t the strongest, he would still at least be second place!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to having such a powerful existence as his dao protector and stood up for him, Immortal Emperor Ren Xian was able to come out to win the throne.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, even this powerful forefather couldn’t survive the tribulation of time. In the end, his lifespan withered and he left this world!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, this old man had just said that only Forefather Asura could fight him from Soaring Immortal.

Many experts glanced at each other after hearing this title.

His profound eyes became dazed as he murmured: “Worldkeeper! He’s actually still alive. This is a surviving True God from the Immortal Slaying War! An ancient legend but there is only one existence in this world that can summon him!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having thought to this point, this undying existence shuddered and immediately climbed back into his coffin without saying anything else.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Worldkeeper!” Long Aotian was astounded and took a step back in horror.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had heard of this name before since he was the successor of his amazing sect.

How many people would dare to claim this magnificent title on top of the True God designation? But both of these things were part of this old man’s title.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an existence with an extremely precious bloodline, an old general that had participated in the Immortal Slaying War and still managed to survive.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not here to harvest your lives so I won’t trouble you any further.” The true god looked at Long Aotian then glanced at some hidden people in the sky and said leisurely: “If your sect still has some imperial princes who think they are amazing, then go for it already. In this generation, my Azure Dragon Legion has received the order of his Excellency and shall trample your sect!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His tone was calm but the content was domineering. Anyone would feel a chill after hearing the old man’s declaration towards Soaring Immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” This was the last of the screamings. The legion had finished sweeping through the entire battlefield and eliminated all enemies. Not a single man from Soaring Immortal was left alive.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They then stopped inside Pearl. The guards from Pearl trembled while looking at them, especially the cold eyes of the older soldiers. They kept on walking backward and didn’t dare to look into their eyes. There was a sharpness within that could pierce the heart, a truly nightmare-inducing endeavor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” In a trice, the entire legion left Pearl and floated to the sky.

It wasn’t shameful for their legions to lose to this one so quickly because this was a force that had participated in an ancient war. They have even massacred the most terrifying race of them all, the Ancient Ming!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This legendary legion worked together with the old sages of the nine worlds to destroy the Dragon Ming Ancient Dynasty and stopped their reign.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very well, we will meet again and my sect will have our payback!” Aotian solemnly said. With that, he instantly disappeared into the horizon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his eyes, they have lost this battle completely!

He kneeled down without saying anything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” All of the soldiers from Azure Dragon formally kneeled down before Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene shocked so many people. Some felt their blood boiling while looking at this invincible legion. However, it was submitting to Li Qiye at this moment. Any man who could stand at such a glorious position would feel an uncontainable excitement. There wouldn’t be more to ask of life.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-a3a3"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Azure Dragon protects the Son of Heaven.
