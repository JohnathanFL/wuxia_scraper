She contained her excitement and bowed towards Li Qiye: “Young Noble, this is the greatest kindness you have given to our Void Imperfection Schools. We will never forget and hope that we shall be able to repay you one day.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While looking at her elegant and mature expression, Li Qiye smiled and joked: “Don’t worry about repaying me. The future is too distant, who can say what will happen? But if you insist, follow your sister’s footsteps and give me a kiss. I don’t mind being taken advantage of again.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her face turned red despite knowing it was an obvious joke. She didn’t know how to properly respond.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Young Noble, I didn’t expect a peerless character like you to have some improper thoughts about someone else’s wife.” Ruyan cheerfully quipped before giving implicative glances at the two.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There will always be some interesting things in life.” Li Qiye didn’t mind the comment and laughed as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan happily grinned: “Sister, what are you afraid of? You want to marry him anyway, so why be hesitant about a kiss? If he actually becomes emperor one day, it will be you taking advantage of him. Not just anyone in this world is qualified to kiss an Immortal Emperor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at this bold girl. She was a demoness who dared to speak her mind, a strong person who could love and hate and be true to her desires.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi’s face blushed even more after being teased like this. She looked just like the sunset on the horizon. Despite her always elegant and graceful bearing, she couldn’t help but lower her head at this moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she mustered courage out of nowhere and seemed to have discarded her inner inhibitions. With a rosy countenance and moist lips exuding her sweet orchid scent, she gave him a kiss on the lips.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though this kiss didn’t last long, she felt a shock run through her body while her heart thumped violently. Li Qiye didn’t expect the dignified Jianshi to actually kiss him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled and didn’t think too much of it. This was just an ordinary event to him, like water flowing downstream. It wasn’t enough to leave any ripples in his dao heart.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, the beginning of everything is difficult, but it will be much easier later on. Perhaps this will be the start of a good marriage.” Ruyan chuckled in response: “Sister, just make up your mind and seduce him to leave behind an imperial bloodline.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This directness embarrassed Jianshi completely as her face became even hotter.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop fanning the flames.” Li Qiye pinched Ruyan’s nose and shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi was still a schoolmaster, so she quickly dispelled her bashful state to regain her graceful bearing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled at the two of them and said: “Okay, the two of you can take a look around. I’ll leave the boneship to you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi found this surprising: “Where will you go?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes turned towards the distance: “I want to go check out the forbidden zone. There’s something I want there.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was his real purpose in visiting the Bonesea. It wasn’t for any treasure, it was solely for this item. After so many years, he finally understood its mysteries and uses.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The forbidden zone!” Both the girls were shaken. This was a place no one dared to enter outside of Immortal Emperors!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many brilliant geniuses have tried to do so. Some Godkings who considered themselves to be invincible also entered. Alas, few could come out alive. Even those who escaped successfully had indelible wounds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really want to go there? I heard the injuries gained in the forbidden zone are impossible to cure.” Jianshi became quite worried.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too terrifying of a location. Even the mighty Zhentian wouldn’t easily tread into that area. He had the ambition to become emperor, so he would still be confident about coming out alive. However, an indelible wound was a real worry. This was something that could shake his dao heart.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a cultivator, having an affected dao heart was the most serious of taboos. It would affect one for a lifetime, and their cultivation might be stuck in the same place forever as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, they were confident in Li Qiye’s strength. Alas, no one could truly be confident in escaping the forbidden zone unscathed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled and replied: “It’s okay, it’s just the forbidden zone. It’s still not the most terrifying place just yet. There are worse locations in this hellhole.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing that he had made up his mind, Ruyan and Jianshi didn’t try to persuade him anymore.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you going there for the item of immortality?” Ruyan winked with a coquettish smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at her and said: “I know what you are thinking, but forget about it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t even say anything yet, do you need to be so cautious and treat me like an outsider?” She pouted in response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you are going to the forbidden zone, what should we do with Fairy?” Jianshi was much more careful and looked at Fairy lying inside the wooden coffin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan was startled as well and added: “That’s right, what if she wakes up and goes crazy again when you aren’t here? We can’t do anything about it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their fear was reasonable since outside of Li Qiye, no one else could appease her. Judging by what they had seen before, once Fairy loses control, the world itself might be destroyed!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye turned quiet for a bit while looking at Fairy. He eventually smiled and said: “Don’t worry, her mind is clear and her emotions are very stable right now. She is only resting, so even if she wakes up, she won’t lose control again.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sisters felt relieved after hearing this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye eventually told the two: “Okay, the two of you can wander around freely. This continent has lost a lot of things, but if you are lucky, you might still find something good.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If that’s the case, you should give us some hints. For example, where we should go and what we should pay attention to.” Ruyan was quick on the uptake.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bottomless greed like a snake wanting to swallow an elephant.” Li Qiye jokingly scolded her: “This place is different from the legacy treasure sea. You can bring treasures away from that place, but here, the focus is on fortune and adventures, not treasures. The latter is not something you can chase after.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan replied: “But there should still be some treasures here. Like you said before, isn’t this the corpse of a Kun Peng? I’m sure it has some supreme treasures hiding inside.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi agreed with this sentiment. They wouldn’t be thinking too much if they didn’t know that this was the corpse of a Kun Peng.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed, the legacy treasures of a divine beast can make the heart beat fast.” Li Qiye spoke with a tinge of emotion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan half-jokingly said: “Should we dig 30,000 feet down to the deepest part of the continent? Maybe we will be able to find its legacy.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not to mention 30,000 feet, even if you flip the entire continent over, it still won’t do. This Kun Peng has been guarded in the past, so even if you dig everywhere, you won’t be able to find anything. Without the right fortune and the corresponding key, the legacy treasures will be unobtainable.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The key? Do you know what it is? How about telling me?” Ruyan chuckled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course I know where it is.” Li Qiye smiled: “However, forget about the legacy treasures because even if I told you, you still wouldn’t be able to get this key.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The key to obtaining the legacy treasures of the Kun Peng was the yellow bell from the Gu Clan!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Noble, are you intentionally teasing my curiosity?” Ruyan angrily stared at him and said: “Since this is the case, you shouldn’t have told me in the first place. Now I’m itching all over with this knowledge.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “What a greedy little beauty. Finding the Windchase Break is already a stroke of luck, so don’t force other things. Just go play around and test your fortunes without being so insistent.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I got it.” Ruyan pouted. She was only trying to satiate her curiosity. The other treasures weren’t too tempting for her because her schools already had too many.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi asked: “What should we tell Fairy if she wakes up?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye remembered something and said: “If she wakes up, tell her that if it is meant to be, we will meet again.
