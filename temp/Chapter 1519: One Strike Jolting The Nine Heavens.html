It cut down everything of his; his vitality, power, and cultivation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were too many questions at the moment of his demise, an end without closure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Poof!” When his eyes closed, the severed neck finally squirted out blood up high like a spring as the headless body fell straight down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next second, Heaven Spirit fell into a deathly silence. All existences felt suffocated. Even the strongest experts and Nine Worlds’ Godkings felt as if they were being strangled. They couldn’t move or resist at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dao Decapitation, the ultimate attack of the Dao Sword! It was prohibitively difficult to unleash this move. Perhaps this was a privilege for an Immortal Emperor after exerting all of their power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Li Qiye was greatly affected after using this attack.

However, for a weapon like the Dao Sword, its ultimate attack was harder to activate than reaching the heavens!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was robbed of their voice and breath. Just a second ago, they were skeptical about his claim. Such a battle achievement would go down in history, something completely comparable to those of emperors. It simply couldn’t happen.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, it was the reality.

They have met emperors, and a few have even trained emperors before. There was nothing in life that could scare them. But at this moment, they felt a sense of dread. It was real and lingered in their minds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After making a name for themselves, they have long forgotten about fear and thought that they were the masters of their own destiny outside of dying from old age!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But today, the long forgotten feeling has returned because of Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh mother…” Many were scared out of their minds in front of their mirrors and dropped butt first to the ground.

It took blood and sweat to build up the prestige and status they had today. Thus, if they didn’t have the courage to fight against a junior, there was no way they could show their faces again in the future. They would forever live in a shadow. If they couldn’t defeat their inner demon, there was no point in seeing the world again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they felt incapable in a direct confrontation, that they were not a match for Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Fengyun finally understood why Li Qiye said he was the master of the situation.
