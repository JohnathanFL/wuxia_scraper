The entire world was engulfed with this particular energy and the Grand Sea was being washed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a series of magnificent sounds, it looked like an unprecedented holy creature was descending from the sky. It carried the power of a heavenly tribulation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A supreme light filled the battlefield and sucked the power from all directions!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remember that this battlefield was empowered by ten earth veins underground. Outside of Immortal Emperor Refined Jades carved outside, it was the majestic worldly energy from the veins that was simply unstoppable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battlefield became heavier after absorbing the energy from the veins. It seemed as if the entire Grand Sea was being refined into this place. More importantly, the battlefield was grasping the entire region's power!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” Scorching flames blazed up in the battlefield. They covered the sky like waterfalls as if this was a punishment from the heaven.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A majestic figure emerged on the battlefield. It was an existence that looked like an angel of great height. It emitted an inviolable light with ten fiery wings on its back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these wings spread open, all of Mortal Emperor World was under their shadows. This was the ruler of the world, it came to sentence its judgment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was wielding a longsword made from heavenly laws twisting together. The scary part was that it carried the power of tribulation and judgment. It didn’t come from the grand dao or the myriad laws but rather, the heaven itself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It represented the will of the high heaven and its judgment. Because of this, it was also the symbol of invincibility. No other existence could stop it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Omnidirectional Immortal Annihilation! This was the ace card of Soaring Immortal. It wasn’t created by their emperor or anyone else since it was from a very ancient epoch.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to deal with the Dark Crow, the mastermind behind Soaring Immortal used this formation that hadn’t appeared before. The mastermind was aware that the Dark Crow knew the arts of Soaring Immortal all too well. Two emperors were even taught by him so using Soaring Immortal’s arts against him was displaying one’s slight skill before an expert.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the mastermind used this Omnidirectional Immortal Annihilation technique that the world had never seen before. Even if it couldn’t kill the Dark Crow, the mastermind still hoped that it would be able to stop the Dark Crow’s legions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Soaring Immortal had to pay a great price to use this formation. It was supported by the power of the earth veins and channeled by the vitality of its disciples. It meant that the vitality and the worldly energy of the earth were fused together.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A long battle would result in depleting their vitality and aging then death. Alas, they had no other choice against something as powerful as Azure Dragon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The gigantic sword unleashed a judgment slash! The will of the heavens was truly hard to resist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat!” Worldkeeper gave the order. The alliance immediately ran back because the slash was aimed at their legion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were also stunned at the immense power and nature of the sword. However, it was too late to run because the slash wouldn’t allow it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” A storm of blood exploded. The entire battlefield looked like an ocean of blood like someone splashing ink onto a picture frame. It had become a scene of hell, a spectacle that would shock everyone here.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire alliance nearly became ashes after this one slash. Only one out of ten survived. Those who were lucky enough to survive would most likely never forget this nightmare from their mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Hai Lin’s alliance was rumored to be ten million men strong, this wasn’t the case. A generous estimation would land it from five to seven millions. After the skirmish earlier, the alliance was brought down to three to four millions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this slash alone took them down to around three to four hundred thousand men. One could imagine how frightening this scene was.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One slash took down three million soldiers. The survivors were completely pale with fear.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” A second slash came downward with the tribulation of the heavens. It was aiming for Azure Dragon this time, wishing to slay the beast.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawrr!” The dragon clawed at the sky. In this split second, it turned into a straight spear with a dragon coiling around it. A draconic aura permeated through the air as if this was about to be the most powerful thrust in the world. It was born from the world so it could resist the will of the heavens!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The spear stopped the slash then slammed into the sword with fiery sparks flying everywhere. The sparks fell down like meteors into the stage, causing it to shake along with the entire Grand Sea!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The spear ultimately couldn’t handle the tribulation sword and was pushed down to the platform from the impact. A terrible hole and cracks appeared on these platforms.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword of this ten-winged creature was too powerful due to the three different forces encompassed within - the earth veins, tribulation power of the heavens, and vitality of the soldiers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawr!” The spear turned back into an Azure Dragon. However, pieces of artifact suddenly came from the horizon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Click! Click! Click!” These exquisite pieces wrapped around the dragon like an armor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” With more metallic noises, a green spear appeared in the claws of the dragon. It emitted a snow-white glow with a murderous aura. It seemed to have been stained with the countless blood of gods and devils.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this weapon, the dragon could meet god, slay god; meet devil, slay devil.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could see this scene at this moment and thought that it was a real dragon protecting the nine worlds, not a legion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the new armaments, the dragon grew larger. Even the ten-winged existence towering at ten thousand meters seemed tiny compared to the azure dragon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the final form of the legion. It didn’t assume the shape of a formation but of a living existence.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless stars exploded under the thrust of this dragon.
