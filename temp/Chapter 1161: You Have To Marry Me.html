<p><b>Chapter 1161: You Have To Marry Me</b></p><p>Li Qiye crossed his arms in front of his chest and leisurely smiled: “May I ask what you are here for, my young miss?”</p><p>She immediately became spirited after hearing his question and glared at him with her big and round eyes: “Why don’t you want to marry me?!”</p><p>“Er—” Li Qiye was caught off guard. Luckily, she spoke in an aggressive manner. If she spoke to him with a tone full of resentment and indignation like an abandoned lover, others would actually mistake him for an unloyal and fickle man.</p><p>He smiled and said while looking straight at her: “Why should I marry you?”</p><p>“Because this lady is the Golden Isle Princess, the number one beauty of the Jade Sea with a supreme and peerless bloodline.” She confidently stated while still posing with her hands on her waist. There was no trace of bashfulness to be found.</p><p>Li Qiye wondered whether he should laugh or cry. He shook his head in response: “And I should marry just because of that? What if a demon dragon comes out of nowhere one day and claims to be the number one beauty, do I have to marry her too?”</p><p>“Bah, who would dare to take my man?!” The unashamed lady claimed while glaring at him: “If you didn’t want to marry me, why did you run here and ruin my business by passing the others on the stage?”</p><p>He shook his head once more: “I can’t be blamed for that, I only fell down from the sky by accident and coincidentally struck your formation.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with that?” She scowled while staring at him with a burning gaze: “It's the providence of the heavens, yet you still dare not to marry me?!”</p><p>To the amusement of Li Qiye, she looked as if she wanted him to take responsibility, prompting him to reply: “So you are saying you are anxious to get married already?”</p><p>“I…” She wanted to erupt but stopped in time: “Bah, don’t think so highly of yourself. Who says I am in a rush to get married?!”</p><p>She simply wanted to kick him out of Golden Isle. Who would want to marry a stranger? Moreover, she was still a little girl, but the moment she returned, she heard some disciples say that someone named Li Qiye might not want to marry her.</p><p>This rubbed her the wrong way. A man actually didn’t want to marry her! Thus, she wanted to come and see just what kind of person would do so.</p><p>He replied: “Then perfect, you don’t want to get married and I don’t want to either. Isn’t this the end of it? Plus, you are still a little girl. Time is still plentiful on this endless road. One day, you will find a suitable man.”</p><p>“Bah, who says that I am still young? I’m an adult already!” The moment she heard the word ‘little’, she was immediately enraged. She hated being called little the most by others, so she grunted unhappily while exaggerating her posture even more by raising her barely gropable breasts.</p><p>Her appearance aimed to tell Li Qiye that she was not little anymore for she was already a grown lady.</p><p>He couldn’t really do anything against this bold girl. He only smiled: “Right, right, you are a grown up already.”</p><p>“Are you a little puppy or something? You are just going along with whatever I say, don’t you have your own thoughts?” She glared at him with disdain. [1. Raw is Pekingese, but this is the first time I’ve heard of this dog breed. The Pekingese is an ancient breed of toy dog that originated in China. They are called Lion Dogs due to their resemblance to Chinese guardian lions.]</p><p>A girl’s mind was already quite fickle, leaving others confused, but on top of this, she was even more unpredictable.</p><p>Li Qiye didn’t argue against her and only leisurely said: “If you have no other business, I’m going to take a nap.” He yawned afterward.</p><p>“Bah, already taking a nap when it is so early, are you a pig?” She really wanted to antagonize him.</p><p>He ignored her and gently waved his sleeve: “I guess I’m a pig then. Please leave if you have nothing else to say, I won’t entertain you anymore.” Li Qiye made it obvious that he wanted to send the guest away.</p><p>However, she didn’t want to leave and answered in a forthright manner: “If I leave after you tell me to leave, won’t I lose all face? Golden Isle is my territory.”</p><p>“Okay, girl, what do you want?” He looked at her and begrudgingly waved his sleeve.</p><p>Few things could deceive his eyes. He knew that the girl was not malicious and only wanted to cause trouble due to the fact that she didn’t want to marry.</p><p>She declared with a domineering presence: “You have to marry me!”</p><p>He took a couple more glimpses of her before wryly smiling: “Little girl, do you know what it means to get married?”</p><p>“Peh! You are the little girl! If you call me that one more time, I’ll personally strangle you to death. No, if you call me a little girl again, I will peel your skin and shred your tendons while drinking your blood!” She gave him a dirty look since she hated being called this the most. [2. This phrase should be familiar by now.]</p><p>“Fine, I’ll just call you girl then.” He raised both of his hands and acted as if he was giving up: “Girl, do you know what it means to get married?”</p><p>“Please, I am not a fool, how could I not know?” She coldly snorted and said: “If I tell you to marry me, then do it, why waste time with so much nonsense?!”</p><p>He curiously looked at her and asked: “If I am not mistaken, you don’t truly want to get married, so why do you want me to marry you?”</p><p>“Hmph! Who says that I don't want to marry?” She arched forward to accentuate her chest again: “I am old now so it is time to start a family.”</p><p>Marriage was an embarrassing topic for many girls, but this little one didn’t care at all. She blurted out her words in a very comfortable and natural manner.</p><p>Li Qiye carefully looked at her up and down, letting her notice his burning eyes. This made her feel very uneasy. After all, although she spoke without reservation, she was still a little lady in the end.</p><p>“What are you looking at, pervert! Keep looking and I’ll claw your eyes out!” She turned fierce and suddenly lunged forward with her fingers aiming for his eyes.</p><p>Naturally, he wouldn’t let her succeed and immediately grabbed her small hand. With her being inches away, he smiled and said: “Since you said you wanted me to marry you, then I am your husband. As your husband, it is not unreasonable for me to appreciate you a bit. Plus, it isn't a big deal. It is not like I was taking your clothes off or anything.”</p><p>“Bah! You old pervert!” Ye Xiaoxiao was still too young so she couldn’t handle Li Qiye. With a blushed complexion, she yelled: “Watch! I’ll teach you a lesson!”</p><p>With that, a snapping whip was heard. In the blink of an eye, a green vine had wrapped around Li Qiye’s arm; it coiled around his body like a demonic snake. The moment it entangled him completely, countless sharp thorns spread out like quills that wanted to suck out Li Qiye’s blood.</p><p>Li Qiye wouldn’t entertain this notion. His Hell Suppressing Godly Physique activated. With popping sounds, the vines surrounding his body were immediately split.</p><p>At this time, Ye Xiaoxiao had escaped Li Qiye’s clutch and spoke: “Hmph, looks like you have some skill.”</p><p>He resumed his gaze that was quite unpleasant to her. It made her feel very uncomfortable but she didn’t want to show any weakness so she instead proudly stood straight with her soft breasts forward while glaring at him with a fiery stare.</p><p>“Have you had your fill?” She snorted in a very arrogant style with black lines on her forehead.</p><p>He withdrew his eyes and said: “I’m really curious about your bloodline now. Not too many things in this world can actually hide from my eyes.”</p><p>She responded haughtily: “Why should I tell you?”</p><p>Li Qiye stroked his chin and quipped back: “If you tell me, I will marry you.”</p><p>This startled her as she blurted: “Who says that I want to marry you, bah!”</p><p>“Little girl will always be embarrassed.” Li Qiye laughed and shook his head: “Earlier, you were yelling and demanding for me to marry you, but now, it is the other way around. Aiz, this is really frustrating. Girl, do you want to marry or not?”</p><p>She stared at him and didn’t say anything for a moment.</p><p>He nonchalantly stood there with grace to let her look as much as she wanted. After a while, he said with a smile: “Girl, have you had your fill? I know I am incomparably handsome, but you shouldn’t be infatuated to this level.”</p><p>Her face turned red as she regained her wits and angrily said: “Bah! Shameless old pervert! Who would be infatuated with you? Go look in the mirror first. Daring to claim to be handsome with your common appearance, have you no shame?”</p><p>Li Qiye ignored her assessment and said: “Okay, girl, stop pestering me endlessly. I actually want to know why you want this marriage. If I’m not mistaken, you have changed your mind for now.”</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
