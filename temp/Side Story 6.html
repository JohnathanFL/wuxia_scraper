His cooking skills were considered the finest so even Godkings cordially called him “Old Bao”.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For Chef Bao, the thing that he was most proud of was not his peerless cooking skills. Even though his steamed phoenix liver, broiled dragon claw, and seasoned tiger eyes were his specialties and renowned in the nine worlds, they were still not his greatest pride. His proudest achievement was to cook for Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This emperor shocked the entire nine worlds. He was unbeaten throughout his life before becoming emperor, completely unparalleled in all the ages.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chef Bao was ready for old age. When he would tell his glorious tales to his grandchildren, of course cooking for the emperor wouldn’t be left out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He woke up very early today and prepared the emperor’s favorite soup. It consisted of Nine Saints Spring, White Mist and Snow Dew, and Seven Stars Immortal Prawn.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He himself was a Godking so it was no problem for him to reach the highest peak or dive deep into the ocean. Before the emperor has woken up, he has already traveled through the world in order to prepare this morning soup for him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the sun rose, the broth was ready. He looked at the steaming soup with great satisfaction and could already imagine the emperor happily eating his favorite soup.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was lost in his fantasy, an imperial aura surged.

There was no need for him to see who he was. In this world, only Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng had this aura.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man came forward with the sun and moon circling around him along with the myriad laws. He had a natural temperament and complete freedom. A single gesture of his could cause all the existences in this world to sway; all existed to worship him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though his divine and imperial aura were hidden, everyone would be willing to submit to him without exception.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng, completely unmatched in this world.

He had half the bloodline of a phoenix. This was an existence who withstood a heavenly tribulation for three years then came back to life with the phoenix rebirth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It swept through the nine worlds without facing resistance but now, Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng killed it and took its liver to be his wine snack.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emperor stepped into the palace and took out his old scroll then began reading its sacred text.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sun shined brightly outside of the window. However, with a single glance of the emperor’s pupils, the sun hanging high became very gentle with its rays falling on his body. It was the utmost comfort and leisure period; everything in this world was in tune with his personal rhythm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, Chef Bao brought up the boiled liver and matched it with the right kind of broth. This was the emperor’s breakfast.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emperor tried them and nodded with a smile: “Old Bao, your broth is simmered to the point of perfection, I must taste it every day.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Bao retired from the hall happily after hearing the praise. He would only cook in this life for the emperor. Even if other gods in this world wanted a taste, they would have to ask other chefs instead!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the emperor was reading, he would laugh at the interesting parts. When he smiled, the world became splendid with the sky clearing up. An immortal aura would engulf the nine worlds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young noble.” An old servant stepped forward during the emperor’s reading hours.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This old servant has always followed the emperor with absolute loyalty.

Her origin was exceptional; her features were impeccable. Her talents were peerless with exceedingly high cultivation. It was hard to find someone comparable to her. She once competed against the emperor for the Heaven’s Will. After losing to him, what she gained was love.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell the fairy to go back, I wish to comprehend the dao today.” The emperor was still smiling freely and answered with a casual response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young noble, you do that every day.” The old servant angrily said: “You are already invincible in this world, it is time to rest now.
