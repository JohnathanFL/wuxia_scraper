It was fused with Zhentian’s ultimate grand dao attack. Because of this, its power far exceeded that of an ordinary Imperial Massacre and could be compared to a massacre that exceeds the limit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Emperor True Treasures had their own spirits.

The supreme grand dao, the imperial grand dao, and even the high heaven’s dao were suppressed. Everything seemed to have been trampled by him and were no longer worth mentioning.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This figure was Li Qiye.

All the laws around the stage lost their brilliance, then the entire place turned to smoke.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was too shocking. This stage was once blessed by countless ancient sages. Even the Soul Massacre earlier couldn’t destroy it.

The world fell into a stillness. Shortly afterward, the experts all bowed on the ground. Even though they were unwilling, Nirvana Heavens and the Heaven Suppression Fist were ultimate creations. The choice was not up to them due to the omnipotent pressure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!

Next came despair. At this moment, his dao heart was completely shaken. If he couldn’t overcome this fear, even if he could stay alive, he would forever be under the shadow of Li Qiye.
