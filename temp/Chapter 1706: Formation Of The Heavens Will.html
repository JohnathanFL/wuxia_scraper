Now, it finally took a unified form in the shape of this maelstrom.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its final form finally appeared with this maelstrom hanging in the sky. Everyone was shocked and wanted to see the finale of the process with their own eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can never get bored of this scene. It’s a life worth living just to watch this formation in each generation.” An old man stared at the maelstrom in the sky and sentimentally commented.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time for many young cultivators so they became quite excited.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The final form is finished, this is when they need to gain its acceptance and be qualified for the competition to become Immortal Emperor.” A member from the last generation murmured.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this stage, the young geniuses needed to be recognized by this entity. Of course, not all of them could do so. For example, the path of the grand era disqualified certain powerful geniuses. The moment they chose the other path, they were no longer connected by fate to the Heaven’s Will.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the path of the heaven users, not all were recognized either without the right conditions. The two disqualifying factors were weak cultivation and imperfect grand dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first was understandable. After all, what was the point of competing if one wasn’t strong enough? Same for the second, creating an imperfect grand dao was a sign of incompetence. They wouldn’t be able to shoulder the power of the Heaven’s Will. Thus, how could such a grand dao be recognized?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven’s Will encompassed the power of the myriad dao in the nine worlds. It was tyrannical and not just anyone could shoulder it. A perfect self-created grand dao was necessary.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, even if someone used the most heaven-defying mean to seize the will, their own imperfect dao would collapse along with their body and true fate.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, after the final form, one needed to be recognized by the Heaven’s Will after reaching an acceptable power level and creating a perfect dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This didn’t mean that they could become an emperor. They still needed to work and defeat the other geniuses before winning ascension.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The maelstrom continued to rotate in the sky without making any sound. It was a soft rotation, nearly imperceptible to spectators.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the maelstrom were flowing dao laws with a unified rhythm. People couldn’t tell whether the Heaven’s Will itself was moving or just the laws inside moving. Each strand of law was newly formed, engulfed by a primordial aura and brimming with power. These laws came from the absolute beginning and carried the strength of this phenomenon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were the laws of the Heaven’s Will, the laws of the beginning of the world, the most tempting part about the Heaven’s Will.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After reaching a certain level, anyone could grasp laws. Emperors could create imperial laws. This type of law was infinitely close to being at the Heaven’s Will level. They were extremely powerful. However, it was only close at best and wasn’t at the same level.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most precious thing about a new Heaven’s Will was that these laws have never been used before. This meant that its strength has never been weakened.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many descendants could exert the awesome power of an emperor after cultivating imperial merit laws. The ones cultivating Heaven’s Will Secret Laws could even show off a power similar to the Heaven’s Will.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it ended at being similar and couldn’t truly compare to the new laws inside the maelstrom. These laws were at the apex of their strength from having never been used before. This was the reason why Immortal Emperors were so untouchable. They had a force unavailable to the rest of the world, one that was pristine.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People were salivating and felt their heart beating faster while looking at the Heaven’s Will. It symbolized invincibility within the nine worlds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” Within this night, certain geniuses were recognized by the entity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One youth was sleeping on a tiny bed. Suddenly, a tiny maelstrom emerged on his forehead. This was the mark of recognition.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn! I got recognized!” The sleeping youth woke up and looked at the tiny maelstrom above his forehead. He was ecstatic and immediately rushed out to tell his seniors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, a goddess and her seniors were staring at the Heaven’s Will. With the same buzzing noise, the mark appeared on her forehead as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Heaven’s Will has recognized you.” The seniors next to her were jubilated and nearly jumped up and down in celebration.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short time, good news traveled all around the nine worlds with qualified youths being granted recognition.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monk from Vajra, Western Bull’s Sacred Supreme, and other geniuses were recognized by the Heaven’s Will. The nine worlds quickly drowned in a furor of excitement.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Jingxian, Ming Yexue, Mei Suyao were recognized as well for the female crowd. For someone like Long Jingxian to not get recognized, all logic would need to be thrown out of the window.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girls were calm after receiving the recognition since they knew that no one could defeat Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Long Jingxian was readying her fists and sharpening her snow-white teeth. She aggressively said: “Hmph, I wonder if that ugly Qiye got accepted yet. I shall take down his arrogant face!” She burst out in laughter while imagining the scene.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the geniuses from the great powers were ecstatic. This was a happy event for them regardless of whether they could become Immortal Emperor or not. It meant that they didn’t waste up to a hundred years of cultivation. Their effort has finally paid off.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, many parties began. Sects gathered together and tried to win some allies for their own candidates as preparation for the competition.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the competition wasn’t only about the candidates but also their backing. Having more allies would boost their strength.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, others were sad too. Some of their prodigies worked hard and were quite powerful yet the Heaven’s Will didn’t recognize them. This group became dejected by the result. Their years of effort were completely wasted. It was too much of a blow to take.</span></p>
