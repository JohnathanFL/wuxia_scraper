<p><b>Chapter 1145: Geezer Su</b></p><p>Among the elders here, there were brothers in the same generation as Old Devil as well as uncles who were older than him. Back then, they opened the seal only to find that the power within was not as simple as they expected. In the end, they had to stay here to guard this place.</p><p>If they didn’t do so, this entire area would turn into an evil land. At that time, not only would the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect turn into ashes, the rest of this land would fall into ruin as well.</p><p>“It was everyone’s fault.” An ancestor gently sighed: “If we didn’t agree and work together to open the seal, we wouldn’t be in this situation today. It is not just your fault.”</p><p>Old Devil sighed as well. It was all due to greed back then. It ruined everything and almost ended the sect completely.</p><p>Li Qiye looked at them and commanded: “Mu Shaodi can stay, the rest of you, leave.”</p><p>The elders glanced at each other. In fact, they didn’t know Li Qiye’s true identity, so they looked at Old Devil instead.</p><p>Old Devil nodded and said: “Elders can go, just leave this place to Young Noble Li. When it is over, everyone can return to the sect.”</p><p>Old Devil was the greatest hope to become an Immortal Emperor. He had a very high position in the minds of these elders. The elders were a bit hesitant, but they still decided to eventually leave after hearing him.</p><p>With their departure, Li Qiye signaled to the Benevolent Saber within the imperial formation by waving his sleeve. With a clank, the saber slightly resonated with a hymn before flying into his hand. The other two weapons also followed and floated above his head.</p><p>He gently stroked the blade afterward. It was flashing with a cold and dreadful glint capable of deterring others from approaching. Its tip could easily pierce a paragon’s body. The saber kept on hymning as if it had seen its master. It looked like it recognized Li Qiye.</p><p>“Benevolent Saber…” Li Qiye gently sighed while holding the blade. Back then, it was quite an undertaking for him to find a destiny true stone for Immortal Emperor Min Ren, eventually refining into this one-of-a-kind weapon.</p><p>“Clank.” The saber returned to its scabbard. He then shifted his gaze towards the huge abyss and told Old Devil: “Open it, I want to see him.”</p><p>“Umm... “ Old Devil hesitated and looked at Li Qiye: “Your Excellency, don’t we need to prepare a bit?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I know what we’re about to face.” Li Qiye slowly replied while staring at the pit.</p><p>Old Devil took a deep breath and channeled all of his blood energy as universal laws emerged. The seal was opened at this time. The old man did not dare to be careless and readied himself for the worst.</p><p>“Clank—” One could see a black energy floating around the pit as if there was boiling water inside.</p><p>“Boom!” With a loud blast, this black energy surged into the sky in an endless and terrifying manner. It was a ferocious reverse waterfall.</p><p>“Buzz—” A faint hum came about. Immortal Emperor laws appeared around the imperial foundation. Its power tried to stop this flood of boiling black energy.</p><p>However, the black energy kept on spewing out. It would eventually fill the entire underground foundation. Even a more powerful foundation wouldn’t be able to seal this torrential black energy.</p><p>“Hahaha…” A shadow rushed out from the pit and laughed: “Junior, you have finally given up. Be smart and scram from this place to avoid making a mistake.”</p><p>This shadow was engulfed in the black energy, making it seem as if it didn’t have a body. It was made up entirely of this dark air and seemed to be able to control this form of energy.</p><p>It looked quite burly and strong, resulting in a very vigorous and mighty presence. Despite being formed from the black energy that gave off a dark and ominous feeling, it had an innate majestic aura.</p><p>“No, I did not give up. I simply let you out today in order to end it all and obtain peace for this land!” Old Devil shook his head.</p><p>“Ha, Junior, you are indeed very powerful, but the best you can do is borrow the power of imperial foundation to suppress me. If you think you can seal or kill me completely, think again. You are not an Immortal Emperor! Plus, I am immortal. Even your patriarch couldn’t kill me.” The shadow declared with a guffaw.</p><p>“After so many years, Geezer Su, you are still the same. You’re still as stubborn as a rock underneath an outhouse, hard and smelly.” Li Qiye slowly spoke at this time.</p><p>His words surprised the shadow. Its eyes immediately fell upon Li Qiye while flashing a dark glint. Anyone would feel creeped out by these pitch-black eyes and wouldn’t dare to do anything.</p><p>However, Li Qiye was unperturbed. He coldly stared back at the shadow.</p><p>“Boy, who are you?” The eyes stained with black energy glared at Li Qiye because Li Qiye called him “Geezer Su.” This was quite astonishing because there should be no one in this world who knew who he was, let alone his name.</p><p>“The person who will not let you rise again.” Li Qiye flatly said: “You are still causing trouble after millions of years. You might not be bored of it, but I have grown a little weary of this game.”</p><p>“You are that damned Dark Crow!” The shadow finally realized something. He took several steps back with a shocked expression before exclaiming: “You are still alive after this long?”</p><p>“You were slashed by the old villainous heavens and pinned to the ground, but aren’t you still alive right now?” Li Qiye chuckled: “If you can live till now, why can’t I?”</p><p>The figure eventually burst out into laughter after taking a long stare at Li Qiye: “No wonder why the junior is so confident, so he found some reinforcements. Hahahaha, damned crow, so what if you are here, what can you do to me? Nail me down again, or maybe you want to kill me?”</p><p>“Hahahaha, you should know that I am unkillable, I am eternal!” It ended with more obnoxious laughter.</p><p>Li Qiye coldly glanced at him and spoke: “Geezer Su, after so many years, you are still indulging in this game. Do you really think that I can’t kill you? What if I uproot this land completely, how much longer do you think you can last? Ten years, maybe a hundred?”</p><p>“Hmph!” The shadow snorted after hearing this. There was a secret in this place that very few knew about it. However, since Li Qiye was the Dark Crow, he was one of those privy to this information.</p><p>“Haha, damned crow, all of this talking boils down to you wanting the thing underground. Otherwise, you and that brat Min Ren wouldn’t have built the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect here.” The shadow coldly retorted.</p><p>“Yes, I did want the item before.” Li Qiye did not deny the shadow: “However, with the passage of time, it no longer matters whether I can take it or not. I have no need to force it. There are many things in this world that I can obtain instead.”</p><p>“Hmph, if that’s the case, then why have you returned? Don’t stand in my way!” It replied.</p><p>“Stand in your way?” Li Qiye laughed in response: “You actually have a future? Even if I don’t stop you, what are you going to do?”</p><p>“Hehe, I will definitely see the sun again and return to the nine worlds!” The shadow laughed imposingly.</p><p>Li Qiye looked down at him and said: “Old geezer, you really think you can change back to the old you? The truth is that you will never be able to since you are already dead!”</p><p>“I am undying!” The shadow interrupted Li Qiye with a roar.</p><p>“Fine, you are undying, then tell me, what do you consider yourself to be?” Li Qiye went on: “You were dead after the tribulation back then. Everything about you turned into ashes! What was left? Only an abomination that is neither human nor ghost, a meaningless existence!”</p><p>“Utter rubbish!” The shadow shouted: “Quit your bullshit! I once reigned over the nine worlds! I protected and saved the human race! When the tyrant came, only I rebelled and attacked him! I am the savior of the nine worlds, the guardian of the human race…!” The shadow became more riled up as he spoke with increasing volume. By the end he was screaming.</p><p>Li Qiye silently stood there and watched the screaming shadow until he could finish venting!</p><p>After screaming for a while, the shadow eventually calmed down and coldly spoke: “In short, I will return to the nine worlds again. That day will surely come!”</p><p>“So what?” Li Qiye insipidly said: “What can you bring to this world even if I let you out? Your power underground will turn this land evil. And have you ever thought of what will become of yourself?”</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
