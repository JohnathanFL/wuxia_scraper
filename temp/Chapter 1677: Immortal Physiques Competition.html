Their vitality erupted and suffocated the spectators, exacerbated by their imperial bloodline that made others want to prostrate.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” Their inner physique appeared at the same time and became radiant like four suns slowly floating up in the sky. This was especially true for the Vermillion Bird Princess. She released a heatwave engulfing the myriad worlds, capable of incinerating everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Four grand completion Immortal Physiques!” Even Emperor Assailants were shocked at this scene.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For cultivators, just one grand completion physique was already amazing. But now, all four imperial princes were at grand completion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye stared at them and smiled leisurely: “Not a bad achievement. An imperial bloodline combined with a grand completion physique, it would be hard not to become an Emperor Assailant at this point. The Soaring Immortal Physique from your sect is the most complete outside of the Physique Scripture, same with your Hell Suppression Godly Physique. Looks like your Indestructible Diamond Physique is from trading with the Silent Orchid Temple, those monks indeed have a unique perspective on this regards, this physique law is not bad at all. As for your maternal Extreme Yang Physique, it’s a bit lacking but you did a good job polishing it inside the prison, not much critique to be had there.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye slowly judged the four grand completion physiques.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Azure Dragon Prince cultivated the secret Soaring Immortal Physique of his sect; the White Tiger&nbsp;Prince had the Hell Suppression Godly Physique, also from the sect. The sect had two physique laws so the Black Tortoise Prince trained in the Indestructible Diamond Physique from a different temple. Meanwhile, the Vermillion Bird Princess inherited the peerless Extreme Yang Physique from her mother’s family. After marrying the emperor, the imperial queen also gave this law to her daughter!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill!” The four of them shouted and attacked in unison. The four grand completion physiques erupted at the same time with their imperial bloodline powering them. This granted them an immensely destructive force.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were four Emperor Assailants in action. Any existence in Mortal Emperor would tremble before this. Time became chaotic; space was destroyed; the myriad dao suppressed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Azure Dragon Prince was like a descending immortal with his incredible attack. This sword slash could cut through the galaxy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Prince was as majestic as a divine mountain.

He was also under his Nirvana Heavens state. The two domains stacked on each other and became much stronger.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four siblings became slower within the domains and felt the pressure instantly. However, their vitality wildly erupted. In a short time, their physiques powered up and immortal armors and weapons appeared to protect them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, these armors and weapons still crumbled beneath the two domains. This didn’t deter them from lunging at him with an oppressive and all-destroying momentum. It was just that their speed and power became much weaker.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye took action again by pointing his finger to the sky to activate Soaring Immortal. The world became dazzling because of his nirvana form illuminating everything. It looked like all the power in the worlds gathered on his body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A gigantic shield materialized in his hand and he threw it out instantly. It surpassed all speed, even the Azure Dragon Prince who had exerted his physique to its limit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Myriad World Soaring Immortal and Hell Suppression Godly Aegis!

They assumed that the siblings would be able to stop all enemies so they didn’t expect this result.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Like I said, it’s not that simple to add or subtract power by just adding people. If you can’t do a good job of working together, you might as well fight alone.” Li Qiye chuckled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Immortal Emperors might have a chance to fight him.

At this moment, they realized they have underestimated Li Qiye. They were at a great disadvantage before the two domains and physique breaks. Because of this limitation, their combined effort was not much more effective than fighting alone. Despite hating him, they admitted that he was right in this regards.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The four stepped forward together and their body became shrouded in flame. The Azure Dragon Prince had a green flame; the White Tiger Prince had a black flame; Black Tortoise Prince had a golden flame while the princess had a frightening sunfire.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawr!” The four beasts roared and the siblings disappeared. The divine beasts emerged before everyone instead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A primordial beastly aura engulfed the world like a flood.
