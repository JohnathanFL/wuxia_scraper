<p><b>Chapter 428: Abundant Harvest</b></p><p>Before anyone noticed, two hours had gone by and Li Qiye still didn’t move; he just stared at the sea. Throughout this time, they didn’t do anything, so the group of Peng Zhuang became impatient.</p><p>Peng Zhuang wanted to ask Li Qiye, but Qiurong Wanxue shook her head at them, signaling for them to not disturb him. The six calmed down and held their breaths while looking at the sea’s surface.</p><p>At this time, Li Qiye then shouted: “Release the nets!” Li Qiye released his net at the speed of lightning.</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue and the six didn’t dare to hesitate; they released their nets with their fastest speed.</p><p>However, the nets had only went down for a moment before Li Qiye shouted again: “Pull them up, fast!” Then, Li Qiye dragged up his own net.</p><p>“Whoosh!” The seven also pulled their nets up and found themselves dumbfounded. A light as bright as the sun illuminated the surroundings, turning the sea’s night into day; it was as if a sun was rising up from their nets.</p><p>Their hands were heavy since there were so many fish the size of a finger jumping around, wanting to escape from their confines.</p><p>They had never seen so many fish like this; this was enough to scare someone to death. Even Qiurong Wanxue was aghast until Li Qiye’s voice rang in her ears: “Catch them, quick!”</p><p>Her body shook once, then she hurriedly caught the fish. The six young ones also calmed down and busily caught their own fish. Their hands were shivering with excitement while they attempted to store them. As the chief, Qiurong Wanxue could be said to be the most composed, but right now, her cheeks were red with excitement. In her eyes, this was simply incredible.</p><p>After putting their fish away, one disciple began to count and then shouted out: “Oh heavens, I… I have a total of eighty-six!”</p><p>The only female disciple jumped up and exclaimed: “I… I have one hundred and seven!” She then kissed Li Qiye on the cheek and happily declared: “Brother Li! You are too amazing!”</p><p>Li Qiye smilingly shook his head and said: “You are molesting me.”</p><p>The embarrassed female disciple let go of Li Qiye, but she was still very excited.</p><p>“A kiss is nothing.” Peng Zhuang smiled and declared: “If Brother Li wants me to kiss you, I’ll be very happy to do so.”</p><p>The other disciples laughed and began to line up as if they were all going to kiss Li Qiye.</p><p>Li Qiye shook his head and said: “No thanks to men, but girls can come for a kiss. How about Chief Qiurong? Will you give me a kiss? I don’t mind.”</p><p>The six young ones were not as bold as Li Qiye, so they didn’t dare to say anything. They turned around to face a different direction, pretending that they didn’t hear anything.</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue’s cheeks were red when she quickly shook her head in response: “No thanks!” She was a bit mad on the inside. Li Qiye, who had been very well-behaved so far, suddenly dared to tease her at this moment. This little brat is now too bold.</p><p>“Nevermind, you chose to give up on this chance.” Li Qiye smirked and said.</p><p>Li Qiye’s teasing agitated Qiurong Wanxue quite a bit. Keep in mind that she was a respected chief in the Snow-shadow Tribe, so how could she not become angry after being teased by a little brat?</p><p>Meanwhile, the young group of six were lost in excitement. Peng Zhuang couldn’t help but ask: “Brother Li, how did you know this place had Yang Nightfish to catch? It is too unbelievable.”</p><p>“Intuition, it is only intuition.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “I don’t know why, but after staying in Nightsea for ten days, I suddenly have this feeling that I could sense the fish in the sea.”</p><p>After hearing this response, the group of six half believed him: “Really?” Why did they not have such an intuition?</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and said: “Why would I lie to you guys? I have been very sensitive from a young age, so if I stayed at any place for a while, I would begin to sense a few things.”</p><p>“Oh, so it is natural.” The six felt that this explanation was trustworthy. Otherwise, how would one explain Li Qiye’s perception of the Yang Nightfish?</p><p>Compared to the younger six, Qiurong Wanxue didn’t trust Li Qiye so easily. In the end, a chief was a chief, so she had much more knowledge.</p><p>She didn’t believe his excuse of it being his intuition and felt that he had hidden secrets. She found it strange that Li Qiye would know the exact time and location of the Yang Nightfish.</p><p>She stared at him, hoping to find some clues, but there were none no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>Li Qiye looked at the moving sea and said: “We’ll go now.” The handler then followed Li Qiye’s directions as they disappeared further in Nightsea.</p><p>The following days, Li Qiye kept on changing the location, and they obtained great harvests each time. It was as if nothing in this mysterious sea could escape his sight.</p><p>The group of six was immersed in excitement; they felt that Li Qiye’s intuition was too magical. It was a shame that it was a natural characteristic; otherwise, they would really want to have it.</p><p>In contrast to the young ones, the rich harvests each day caused Qiurong Wanxue to become even more suspicious. She knew that it was something other than intuition, but she couldn’t pinpoint it at all.</p><p>Outside of excitement and disbelief at the quantity of Yang Nightfish, she became even more vigilant. She wondered what type of person Li Qiye was. Why did he want to go with the Snow-shadow Tribe? Since Li Qiye could catch so many fish by himself, there was no reason for him to go with them.</p><p>With this ability of being able to guess where the fish will appear, he would be quite a welcomed guest at any emperor’s lineage. However, he ultimately chose to go with them, so Qiurong Wanxue speculated for a long time about the reason why he decided to follow them.</p><p>In theory, there was nothing worthwhile at the Snow-shadow Tribe for Li Qiye. It was only a minor tribe; they didn’t have supreme treasures nor apex merit laws. If he channeled his skills to work for a great power or an emperor’s lineage, he would surely have better returns.</p><p>This was the other big question in her mind, next to Li Qiye’s fish-predicting ability.</p><p>“If it is this easy to catch Yang Nightfish, why don’t Necropolis’ inhabitants catch them themselves?”</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue answered in a serious manner: “These fish are not this easy to catch. It is all due to Young Noble Li, understand?” Despite her many questions and doubts, Li Qiye had brought a lot of benefits to them, so she would remember this kindness in her heart.</p><p>“Ah, I was just casually wondering.” Peng Zhuang quickly said: “Brother Li, how about you come to our Snow-shadow Tribe? Although we don’t have any human members, I’m sure that the chief and the elders will welcome you with open arms.”</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue said in a serious tone: “Peng Zhuang, don’t babble nonsense!” Despite being only thirty, Qiurong Wanxue was the chief and she had great prestige in the tribe.</p><p>Peng Zhuang didn’t dare to continue the topic after the interjection, so he quickly shut up after cheekily sticking out his tongue.</p><p>The only female disciple curiously asked: “If Nightsea is within Necropolis, how come the ghosts there don’t catch them?”</p><p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer the question. Instead, he then looked at Qiurong Wanxue.</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue shook her head to say: “I don’t know the specifics. A legend says that the sentiments in Necropolis cannot come to this place. They are not actual ghosts or living beings, they are only things without a body. If they come to Nightsea, then they would disappear right away.”</p><p>Peng Zhuang looked at the handler at the back and said: “No wonder why the handlers have a body.” After their stay together, the Snow-shadow Tribe understood that these handlers were different from the ghosts back in Necropolis. The ghosts didn’t have a body while the handlers did.</p><p>Under Li Qiye’s lead, the group had quite a frightening harvest after catching fish for a whole month. Today, Li Qiye looked at the sky and declared: “Tomorrow will be our last round. Then, we’ll leave Nightsea.”</p><p>“Okay!” The group of six excitedly replied. They had a lot of fish, so they were ready to go back to shore to trade with Necropolis’ inhabitants. Maybe they could even trade for some amazing treasures.</p><p>Unlike the happy youths, the calm chief, Qiurong Wanxue, looked at Li Qiye who was sitting peacefully at the bow. She then sat down next to him.</p><p>The six youths saw the chief sit next to Li Qiye, so they winked at each other and turned away, pretending to be deaf and mute.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
