<p><b>Chapter 133 :&nbsp;Evil Root Underground (1)</b></p><p>Later on, he even tried to pull some strings for them. It was fitting because they saw eye to eye. As the witness, he contributed and pushed this couple forward.</p><p>At that point, he wanted to groom an Immortal Emperor, but since the princess’ heart was not into it, he could only give up. From then on, he paid little attention to the Jade Valley Country.</p><p>Even so, having been taught by Li Qiye, the Progenitor of the Jewel Pillar Sacred School didn’t shame Li Qiye. He became one of the strongest Virtuous Paragons in that generation, and he could be considered invincible. Eventually, he established the Jewel Pillar Sacred School.</p><p>During that era, the world all knew that the Progenitor was a grand completion Saint Physique, and he was considered the strongest within that era. The truth was that they didn’t know that the Empress of the Jade Valley Country, behind the curtain of being a virtuous wife and good mother, was even stronger than her husband. She had the Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique at grand completion. If she took action, she would absolutely be able to suppress the strongest contemporary Virtuous Paragon!</p><p>Li Qiye didn’t force the loving couple nor did he bring them along to the cruel war for the Heaven’s Will. He only gave them his best wishes. Later on, he traversed the nine heavens and ten earths and found a suitable candidate to become the next Immortal Emperor!</p><p>“How do you know all of this?”</p><p>Chen Baojiao stared in astonishment at Li Qiye. This was impossible. As a child of the direct branch of the Chen Clan, she didn’t know all of these secrets. However, this fifteen year old boy knew everything about the Chen Clan — this was unthinkable.</p><p>“This is nothing, there are no secrets in this world to me.”</p><p>Li Qiye prosaically uttered, but there was absolute confidence in his words!</p><p>Chen Bao Jian sat there for a long time without saying anything. After a while, she couldn’t help but ask:</p><p>“My, is my problem solvable?”</p><p>“It’s possible.”</p><p>Li Qiye nodded his head and said:</p><p>“As long as you cultivate the Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique. This will not only solve your problem, but in the future, you will have the opportunity to sweep through the Eight Desolaces, and have a chance to climb to the peak.”</p><p>“You have this physique merit law!”</p><p>Chen Baojiao hurriedly exclaimed.</p><p>Li Qiye leisurely said:</p><p>“In this entire world, since the beginning of time, only I will have the Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique. There is no one else besides me!”</p><p>At this point, Chen Baojiao’s plump and full breasts were quivering up and down akin to incessant, powerful waves, and exuded an air of irresistible charm in a magnificent spectacle.</p><p>Li Qiye stared at her and smiled:</p><p>“Since you don’t want to marry Dao Child Shengtian, everything is easy to solve. Follow me. As for the Heavenly God Sect and the Jewel Pillar Sacred School, I will take care of them for you.”</p><p>“Marry you?”</p><p>Chen Baojiao’s charming eyes became wide open, and she glared at Li Qiye.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Li Qiye shook his head and said:</p><p>“How about becoming my maid? I just so happen to be missing a capable assistant.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Chen Baojiao’s face was flushed red, and she angrily glared at Li Qiye. She bit her teeth and stared at him with hatred, then she exploded:</p><p>“Little Demon, are yo-you trying to insult me or not! If you keep on spewing rubbish, I will tear your repulsive mouth to pieces!”</p><p>Li Qiye glared at her as he remained carefree. Then, he said:</p><p>“Beauty — it is truly capable of toppling cities and kingdoms, but in my eyes, it is simply a container made out of skin and flesh; it is just a fair human skeleton. Dao Child Shengtian loves it, even everyone else loves it, but this doesn’t mean that I will value you. In my eyes, it is only because of the Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique…”</p><p>“… Even though you could be considered to be a supreme beauty, but in front of me, don’t think too highly of yourself. Geniuses — so what? Peerless beauties, and then? If they are of no use to me, then they can’t reach the apex. In my eyes, they are no different from ordinary people. If they block my path, be they geniuses or beauties, I will still kill without mercy!”</p><p>Li Qiye slowly articulated those words with a mundane tone. However, within these words hid a domineering presence that was enough to proudly lord over the nine heavens and ten earths with a murderous and bloody sensation.</p><p>Chen Baojiao could smell the stench of blood after the last sentence. She had heard of Li Qiye’s recent actions. He buried more than ten thousand experts and slayed Nantian Hao in cold blood. He was definitely not a kind-hearted person!</p><p>Li Qiye slowly continued:</p><p>“How do you compare to Shuangyan? She has a Saint Fate, a King Physique and a King Wheel. She is the princess of Old Ox Country and the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Do you think she is any lesser compared to you? Yet she is still my maid, so what do you think? Standing next to my side, you will be able to climb to the peak. In the future, you will understand how wise this choice was!”</p><p>In a flash, Chen Baojiao was shocked. She originally thought that Li Qiye was arrogant because he married Li Shuangyan, but she didn’t know that Li Shuangyan’s status was only a maid that was next to him! Thinking about it, Li Shuangyan followed all of his commands, so these were not outrageous words!</p><p>She was in internal conflict. Li Shuangyan was a recognized genius in the Grand Middle Territory. She took action several times and she was clearly stronger than Dao Child Shengtian, but she was willing to stay beside Li Qiye as his maid. Compared to Li Shuangyan, she had nothing to be arrogant about!</p><p>Chen Baojiao sat there in a daze. One could say that wherever she went, she would be considered the moon that was surrounded by the stars, always dazzling. At this moment, her pride was shattered, and she couldn’t be proud even if she tried.</p><p>“Think about it carefully.”</p><p>In the end, Li Qiye gave her a glance and said:</p><p>“Of course, I won’t force you. Once you figure it out, you can find me at any time. Remember, don’t be too late and waste the best time to cultivate, this would be self-destructive for your future. Also, sooner or later, there will be someone else who will stand beside me, and there will no longer be a spot for you.”</p><p>Finally, Chen Baojiao and her carriage driver left first. Then, Li Shuangyan and Niu Fen returned.</p><p>Li Qiye and Chen Baojiao talked for such a long time but Li Shuangyan didn’t know the topic. Li Shuangyan, seeing Li Qiye smile as he watched Chen Baojiao’s departure, she glanced at him and asked:</p><p>“What did you see in her?”</p><p>Of course, Li Shuangyan didn’t think that Li Qiye was valuing her beauty. If he really craved her beauty, then he would have already directly took her by force and killed Dao Child Shengtian with his arrogant nature.</p><p>“Her Physique.”</p><p>Li Qiye smilingly said as he comfortably stretched his tired back.</p><p>“A Saint Physique?”</p><p>Li Shuangyan was shocked inside, but she felt this was impossible. If Chen Baojiao was a Saint Physique, then many people would have known about it sooner. If she truly was a Saint Physique, then the Jewel Pillar Sacred School wouldn’t be willing to marry her off to Dao Child Shengtian. One has to know that the school had many Physique Merit Laws, including Saint Merit Laws. If they could develop a grand completion Saint Physique disciple, then unless a grand completion Immortal Physique came out, this would be akin to invincibility!</p><p>“No, a Houtian Physique.”</p><p>Li Qiye shook his head and said:</p><p>“The Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique.”</p><p>“Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique?”</p><p>Li Shuangyan was a bit surprised. She had never heard of this Physique before, so she asked:</p><p>“Just a Houtian Physique?”</p><p>Houtian Physiques could be said to be worthless. Many great sects and powerful countries all had disciples with Houtian Physiques. Xiantian Physiques were much more superior, which rendered Houtian Physiques to be completely useless!</p><p>“Don’t look down on this Physique.”</p><p>Li Qiye said:</p><p>“If she could reach grand completion with this Physique, then even with your grand completion Immortal Physique, it would still be a challenge to you. From the past till now, this Physique had only appeared three times, and she is the third!”</p><p>An earthquake shook in Li Shuangyan’s mind. A grand completion Immortal Physique — this was such a frightening existence. There was a legend that there were Immortal Physiques at grand completion. Even though they didn’t become Immortal Emperors, they maintained the qualifications to challenge Immortal Emperors!</p><p>Grand completion Immortal Physiques symbolizes invincibility. Even against an Immortal Emperor, even if they couldn’t defeat him, they would still be able to withstand his attacks.</p><p>If her Immortal Physique reached grand completion, this would be completely feasible. However, to think that a Houtian Physique at grand completion could challenge an Immortal Physique — this was an impossible matter.</p><p>“There is such a Physique in this world?”</p><p>Li Shuangyan murmured.</p><p>“You and her are a pair, nothing could be better. In the future, when both of you join forces with two grand completion Physiques, you two will be unbeatable in the entire world. Heh, fighting against Forbidden Burials, trampling the Ancient Earth — nothing is impossible!”</p><p>Li Qiye narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Li Shuangyan was touched. Grand completion Immortal Physique, and two of them at that; how terrifying was this? From the past till now, she had never heard of two grand completion Immortal Physiques coming from the same power.</p><p>“But, she is betrothed to Dao Child Shengtian.”</p><p>Li Shuangyan worried for Li Qiye and said:</p><p>“You are stealing from the Heavenly God Sect and the Jewel Pillar Sacred School.”</p><p>“Why not? As long as she is willing to be my maid, should the Heavenly God Sect dare to block my path, I will stomp it to destruction!”</p><p>Li Qiye smiled and said.</p><p>His ambition and determination was not stoppable by anyone. One day, he will bring an invincible force to kill all the way back to the Immortal Demon Grotto. One day, he will annihilate the Immortal Demon Grotto!</p><p>When Li Qiye brought Li Shuangyan back to the crater, they saw Chen Baojiao standing there as well. There were not many clans or sects here, the rest of them all went down with the Heavenly God Sect and the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom.</p><p>Li Qiye smiled towards Chen Baojiao and asked:</p><p>“So? Still hesitating?”</p><p>Finished speaking, he rode the snail down below.</p><p>Chen Baojiao slightly scowled and rushed down below in her carriage. The moment they went inside this bottomless crater, they found that the area below was much bigger than the entrance above, like a large pottery jar.</p><p>Plus, there were many caves here with staggered branches, like a bee’s nest. It would be very easy to become lost once inside.</p><p>Standing under the cavern, Li Shuangyan couldn’t help but exclaim while looking at Li Qiye:</p><p>“Could it be that this place used to have a great tree? And this place was the main root of the tree?”</p><p>The scene in front of them truly looked like an area where there used to be a great tree with countless holes, or rather, the places where the roots used to be.</p><p>“Correct. The Evil Typha Tree — born in a very ancient era and rooted in this small world, it was an existence comparable to the gods.”</p><p>Li Qiye nodded his head and said.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
