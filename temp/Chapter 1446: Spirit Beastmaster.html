This was a fist that used the pure destructive power from the source of the sun.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just this fist was more than enough to instantly annihilate Huang Yuxuan and several hundred disciples from the Spirit Abyss. They evaporated from this world without leaving behind any ashes. It was as if Li Qiye had completely erased all traces of them, as if they were never here in the first place.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye had perfect mastery of his Myriad Dao Fists. It could even be said that the various fists have been trained back to the level of their origin and have assumed the form of their Immortal Physiques. Even though these fists still had quite a gap compared to the actual physiques, their power was still quite unimaginable at this particular level.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With respect to the Extreme Yang Physique, if he chose to cultivate it, it would be even more powerful than the physique from the Extreme Yang School since he had access to the Physique Scripture.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, if it was the same technique at the same cultivation, his Extreme Yang Physique would absolutely crush the Extreme Yang Monarch’s physique.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to his own understanding of the Physique Scripture, his fist techniques had a similar power to the school’s Extreme Yang Physique.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was why these fists were so frightening, especially after being trained to the limit. Li Qiye could do whatever he wanted. He could even fuse them together to exponentially amplify their effects.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivators at the scene were completely awestruck after seeing the complete annihilation of the abyss’ force. When the fight first started, they had already expected for the abyss to fail. If the result was a bit better, some would even be able to escape.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, no one expected this utter defeat; they couldn’t even block one move from Li Qiye before being completely erased from this world!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Pixiu Formation had trapped the monarch before, but it felt incredibly vulnerable in front of this one punch. Just thinking about it left people shivering in fear.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Li Qiye’s power was as clear as day to the crowd. Back during the fight between Li Qiye and Zhentian’s avatar, it was still quite difficult to gauge Li Qiye strength. After all, Zhentian’s might made it difficult for people to compare.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these several hundred disciples here were a much better reference point. In order to judge Li Qiye’s strength, they only needed to consider the gap between themselves and Huang Yuxuan.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This comparison made them break out in cold sweat. Even the paragons from the previous generation were horrified. Shortly afterward, they were certain that they wouldn’t be able to block a single move from Li Qiye. This disparity in strength had become too obvious and considerable. Many quietly retreated and stayed far away from Li Qiye. They simply didn’t dare to provoke Fierce.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After killing the abyss’ forces, Li Qiye leisurely mumbled: “Too weak.” He uttered the words in a casual manner and didn’t pay it any mind. It was as if this event was no different than trampling an ant.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one dared to breathe out loud at this moment lest they incite his wrath. Perhaps it would bring about a familial extermination. After a long time, a cultivator suddenly realized something and quivered in fear: “Li Qiye isn’t suppressed, he’s not affected by Godhalt…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The listeners shuddered in fear. Just how strong was Fierce to not be suppressed at Godhalt?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They wanted me to apologize, right? Fine, I’ll go then.” Li Qiye’s gaze fell upon the inn named Illustrious and went there with the two girls in tow.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people were slack-jawed after seeing him walk in that direction. On top of the slaughter just now, he even wanted to go to the Illustrious Inn to cause more trouble. He wanted to pull out the roots!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A powerful paragon couldn’t help but say: “The abyss messed with the wrong person this time. To provoke Fierce like this is really inviting destruction.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re too used to being arrogant, it’s about time someone gives them a taste of their own medicine.” Some were secretly gloating with glee.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was virtually impossible to not be annoyed with the abyss after coming to Godhalt, but they had no choice other than to play the part. Only the truly powerful would be fine with not giving the abyss any consideration. The majority had to pay tributes and protection fees.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This prompted dissatisfaction for many. Alas, this was Godhalt, and it had become a custom of sorts. People could only endure this tradition.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So now, when Fierce was causing trouble for the abyss, many felt very happy. Even though they didn’t dare to express this publicly, they were feeling quite good inside. It was about time for someone to teach this overbearing sect a lesson.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Illustrious Inn was the largest inn at the Divine Tree Ridge. It was opened by the withered and built on top of a tree that pierced the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, the entire venue had been reserved by the abyss’ sect master, the Spirit Beastmaster, who was receiving guests. Of course, only those with great backgrounds were eligible for such treatment, such as ancestors from imperial lineages.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beastmaster was drinking tea with an ancestor at this moment. The ancestor was from the Ancestral Terra — an immensely prestigious background.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this was any other place, a sect master wouldn’t be qualified to sit; they wouldn’t be on the same level as this ancestor. However, at Godhalt, even a behemoth like the Ancestral Terra had to give the abyss some face. After all, the disciples of the Ancestral Terra were still suppressed by Godhalt. They needed the abyss’ help to lift this suppression.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a darker side to all the tributes and gifts that get handed to the abyss. Those who enter Godhalt without visiting the abyss wouldn’t receive any help from them. Moreover, this sect would purposely cause trouble or even rob them. A common fate would be getting killed in order to keep this a secret. This was precisely why many cultivators went missing at Godhalt. Outside of the dangers looming on this continent, a considerable amount of outsiders were robbed and killed by the abyss. In fact, the majority of visitors were aware of this, but no one dared to expose it since they still needed the abyss’ assistance while visiting Godhalt.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beastmaster was talking about worldly affairs while keeping this ancestor company. Rumor has it that this person’s heavenly reflection could summon various divine beasts and use their power. Because of this, others referred to him as the Spirit Beastmaster.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, the beastmaster suddenly put down his teacup and looked outside. His eyes immediately turned cold.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two people came inside the inn — Li Qiye and Ye Xiaoxiao. Although the master had never met Li Qiye before, he had seen his portrait. He knew what happened the moment Li Qiye showed himself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be that Spirit Beastmaster.” Li Qiye stood there and glanced around before staring at the beastmaster.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many cultivators were watching from afar. They all followed Li Qiye here and hoped that he would be able to teach the abyss a lesson.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye!” A murderous glint emerged in the beastmaster’s eyes. He understood that his disciples were finished off.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made him gnash his teeth in anger. At Godhalt, who would dare to touch their tiger’s whiskers? But now, not only did Li Qiye kill their disciples, he also killed the beastmaster’s direct disciple, the next sect master!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, that’s me.” Li Qiye leisurely smiled: “I heard your abyss wanted me to confess my crimes.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beastmaster coldly uttered: “It’s too late for that now!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, I see.” Li Qiye chuckled before continuing: “I didn’t want to confess anyway. It’s only the Spirit Abyss, there’s not much to it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators had grown accustomed to his arrogance. They felt that this was only natural. It would be strange if Li Qiye wasn’t this aggressive.</span></p>
