This only further enraged the ancestors with fire in their eyes. They wanted nothing more than to tear him to pieces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Would you like to hear my opinion?” After cleaning his hands, he calmly said: “I’ll go ahead. Why bother killing and seeing blood because of this?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ultimately, both clans still want to keep the alliance, not wanting to break all pretense since you still need to face the lurking Soaring Hawk. If this is the case, then let bygones be bygones. The sky wants rain and a child wants its mother; just let them be.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a bit before continuing: “Your clans are still in a marriage alliance, at least from the last generation. Thus, why the need to break a couple and force a loveless marriage? As for your Dongfang Clan, will you feel better after killing me, the adulterer? You still won’t be able to get a Wenren girl into your clan as a bride. As for the Wenren Clan, would you feel better by imprisoning your own daughter, never letting her see the sun again?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the end, your Dongfang Clan will be responsible for this imprisonment. The grudge will still be there after the punishments are carried out.” Li Qiye said with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, don’t bother trying to spout your nonsense!” A Wenren Ancestor furiously shouted to shut him up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this complication, the Wenren Clan was at fault so they hoped that everything would be over with.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense?” Li Qiye shook his head: “I’m only showing you the correct way. It’s not like the alliance won’t be there without a marriage. The powerful foe will still be there. Your alliance is not predicated on benefits, it is necessary to combat the existential crisis. No matter how you looked at it, your two clans need to stay together. When the mouth is open, the teeth will be cold…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since it is so, why not be more benevolent and just let this thing pass? Don’t let this failed marriage leave a knot in your mind. Killing me and imprisoning the daughter from the Wenren won’t solve anything. Let’s be honest, both sides do not like the current situation but everyone should let it go for the sake of the future.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye’s spiel was endless and made the ancestors quite angry.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Dongfang Cong stood up and said: “Fellow Ancestors, I feel that this makes sense. Our alliance is not because of the marriages. We have been close for many years now with ties as deep as the ocean and vast as the mountains. Even without the marriages, our friendship still has roots from the past. Since this is the case, why should we turn a wedding into a funeral? Why not just let this pair be together? It will be a happy commotion instead if we can see past this. Everyone will feel better and it won’t affect the friendship between our clans.” Dongfang Cong carefully articulated in a solemn manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cong’er, don’t listen to his nonsense.” One Dongfang Ancestor immediately stopped him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye, on the other hand, started clapping: “Good, well said, what a prodigy. Your attitude is worthy of being in my sight. With such a heart, there is no fear of not accomplishing great deeds.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How presumptuous!” The Dongfang Ancestor could no longer stop himself from shouting: “Junior, we still haven’t torn you to pieces because we respect the Wenren Clan but you dare to run your mouth?! Take him outside, kill him!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some experts immediately rushed towards Li Qiye. For both of the clans, leaving him behind would only cause more problems. Why not just kill him now?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye simply smiled and still remained seated as the experts headed for him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wenren Lurui could only sigh. She couldn’t help him at all since she was having trouble protecting herself, let alone assisting him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, loud commotions came from outside. It sounded like fighting.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on?” The ancestors here were surprised and didn’t want further complication.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ancestor, not good, Hai Yangying is here.” An expert from the Dongfang Clan rushed in with sorry appearance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestors were alarmed after hearing this! Even the experts wanting to catch Li Qiye stopped and looked outside nervously.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on? I’m visiting in good faith but was faced with swords? This is the hospitality of the Dongfang Clan?” A hearty laughter came from outside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next, a youth came in with a vigorous aura and a pair of sharp hawk eyes, capable of piercing through everyone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two rows of experts accompanied him. It was clear at first glance that they were quite formidable and aggressive.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hai Yangying.” Everyone’s expression darkened outside of Li Qiye after seeing the youth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dongfang Clan Master, you greet guests with swords?” Yangying smiled and said after rushing into the chamber.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clan master and the ancestors here weren’t happy.

Rumor has it that he was about to take over as the next king. Moreover, his talents were quite great. He had the potential to become the strongest in the State of Soaring Hawk. Jianshi and Cong in the same generation were no match for him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nephew Hai, it must have been a long journey. Please go rest in our esteemed guest quarter. The Dongfang Clan will treat a guest well.” The Dongfang Clan Master replied.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though there has been constant friction between the clans and Soaring Hawk, they were small-scale skirmishes.
