Figures emerged within as these strands of light were woven together. They looked just like deities.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Li Qiye has finally appeared riding the Tetra-war Bronze Chariot.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawr!” A large Qilin pulled the chariot with wondrous speed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aooo!” A White Tiger was maintaining the rear.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A True Dragon circled on the right side while issuing its cry followed by a mighty phoenix hymn.

Despite being his master in-name, she was willing to take up this role for him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The palaces began to rotate. Some deities inside were prostrating on the other ground while others slowly raised both hands to the sky. One golden path stretched from their hands. In the blink of an eye, this supreme path spanned from the ocean all the way to the Broken God Cliff. The chariot crushed through space while traveling on this path.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this pathway powered by the deities, the lords of this world kneeled in fear, not daring to move an inch!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, his prestige subjected the world to an immense pressure. Despite his ordinary appearance and a lack of invincible aura, his thirteen palaces have already represented everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the master of the nine worlds, the tyrant of the myriad ages, an existence above the deities and emperors. The myriad dao and the yin and yang must prostrate before him!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene shocked all of Heaven Spirit. Both ancestors that have been sealed for millions of years and untouchable monsters were completely speechless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under such a grandiose mobilization, people couldn’t help feeling a sense of reverence as if they were greeting an Immortal Emperor. Such sincere respect came from the bottom of the heart and mind!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A man should aspire to be like that, to exceed the ages and become the master of the nine worlds!” Many felt their blood boiling with heroism and wanted nothing more than to join Li Qiye’s banner, ready to contribute to his cause!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder why he is so overbearing and treats others with disdain. Look at those palaces, just this achievement alone is peerless in history.” An old undying was stunned before the suppressing palaces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s him, it’s really him!” Meanwhile, even a character like the Hallowed Ancestor was aghast. He had taught two sea gods and proudly walked over the nine worlds before. However, his legs turned weak at this moment with the urge to kneel and a non-dissipating sense of admiration in his heart.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For him, this wasn’t shameful at all. Fear was normal to face such an existence. This was someone who has slaughtered Immortal Emperors before. He was not even an ant compared to the being moving in his gaze.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even kneeling before Li Qiye wasn’t embarrassing at all!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The mythical chariot, Tetra-War. That’s him for sure…” After a long time, emotions still overwhelmed Hallowed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite being called a cliff, it wasn’t in front of a mountain or inside the ocean. It was part of the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a million miles of this expanse were stony debris. The small ones were the size of a finger while the large was as big as an island.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the center of this vast area was a huge cliff.

Its origin was unknown. Rumor has it that all supreme battles in this world would take place here. This was the reason why it was so broken. But strange enough, it never collapsed completely even after each great battle.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After arriving at the cliff, Li Qiye sat above everyone and glanced at Shen Mengtian and Stygian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such fanfare.” Stygian coldly uttered. Both Shen Mengtian and his expression darkened after seeing a junior putting up an act before them, especially the thirteen palaces sealing all of Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monarch has fought all over the nine worlds before. However, his display was one step below this junior today.

I’m afraid you can’t even if you wanted to!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such retort left the monarch furious without a response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, so many heavenly mirrors were pointed at the cliff. Many great powers and imperial lineages were watching. The disciples from these sects greatly enjoyed Li Qiye’s retort.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These invincible existences have always been imperious but now, they have been slapped by a junior.

Each of the members was full of life. It gave the feeling that they were trees themselves and the square was a great forest. A fresh air flowed everywhere with majestic lifeforce, allowing others to be brimming with vitality.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The legion protected an old man.
