Terror overwhelmed him; the ever-present confidence he once had has crumbled; his fearless being felt apprehension.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, he was drowned in despair because of Li Qiye’s thirteen palaces. This wasn’t something he could ever surpass regardless of how powerful he became in the future. Li Qiye would always be a demon in his nightmare and never allow him to find solace.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like Li Qiye had said, even if he were to survive after this defeat, he would never be able to escape from Li Qiye’s shadow. He would be subjected to living in fear for an eternity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd, at this moment, was rightfully apprehensive. Some gasped for breath due to the terrorizing atmosphere permeating the air. They knew that Zhentian had lost himself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, go!” At this time, the white general suddenly rushed forward and blocked Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-9d06"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bai’er!” Zhentian trembled and shouted after seeing this. </span></span><a href="#footnote-9d06">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave!” The general shouted again as his blood energy poured out completely: “As long as the verdant hills remain, there is no fear of running out of firewood. You can still start over again later!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, a loud blast resounded. He had begun to burn his longevity blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this split second, he burned his own grand dao as well. Everything was sacrificed with this final attack. A crimson spear as red as blood appeared before him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian shuddered as he knew what his disciple wanted to do. He bit his teeth and entered the valley to escape by jumping into the next domain since he agreed with the general’s belief.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A dao of the spear condensed on the physical weapon itself. It shouldered everything from the general; all of his vitality, longevity blood, life force, and his grand dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, he has given up everything and focused it all in this spear. This was his final and most powerful attack!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged general’s hair turned white. He instantly turned into an eighty-year-old mortal. Even his back hunched over.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked to see this scene. They understood that this was akin to an act of suicide. Even if he could somehow win this battle, he would surely die for all of his essences have been used up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye! Talk to my spear before thinking about crossing!” The decrepit general might be bending over, but his battle intent was still surging like before. He came forward without any signs of fear.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye, in his Nirvana Heavens, form flatly said: “Commendable courage. Alas, it is throwing an egg at a rock.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So be it!” The general cried out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” A spear crossed the sky courageously with no return!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This move was the definition of total offense. The general had openings everywhere as he flew forward with his spear to kill Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his mind, the outcome didn’t matter. He only wanted to buy time for his master to escape.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This attack created a solemn and stirring atmosphere with a resounding war intent. The White General gripped his spear while veins popped up everywhere. One could see the determination and seriousness in his eyes!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Li Qiye threw a direct punch at the tip of the spear. Under this crushing blow, the spear began to bend.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The general howled: “Die!” The blood staining his clothes didn’t deter him at all. He continued forward in a frenzy. Even though his spear was becoming deformed, he still mustered all of his strength.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite knowing that he was no match for Li Qiye, he refused to let go and was ready to face death. It was nothing to him as there was only one firm will in his mind — stopping Li Qiye!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Like Li Qiye had said, this was only throwing an egg at a rock. Even the White General’s ultimate attack with his spear that contained his everything was futile against Li Qiye’s Nirvana Heavens.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spear eventually shattered and the punch made contact with his chest. With a bone breaking sound, Li Qiye actually showed mercy and didn’t pierce through his opponent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth was that it didn’t really matter for the end would be the same. Whether Li Qiye killed him or not, the general wouldn’t be able to escape this fate due to his offering to the ultimate strike. His conviction was the only thing that allowed him to stand right now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He fell from the sky and slowly closed his eyes. Even though he couldn’t stop Li Qiye for long, his master was still able to escape. This was a death without any regrets.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd lamented with sorrow while watching his falling body. For many people, the result didn’t matter either. The most important thing was his admirable courage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” He slammed into the ground and died without any resentment or regrets.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s a real man.” Li Qiye said: “Any master would be proud to have such a disciple.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd gazed at his corpse and was shaken. The older cultivators were sighing left and right. For them, if they could train such a disciple, their life would not have been wasted due to the pride they would have.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bury him.” Li Qiye glanced at the corpse before taking Su Yonghuang deeper inside the snow valley to jump into the next domain.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majority of the people here gave chase right away. Some charming spirits stayed behind and buried the general and even erected a tombstone for him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knows if Meng Zhentian or the Dream Empyrean will ever come back to pick up his remains for a proper burial later.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the jump, people found this domain to be a vast prairie. It was a scene of green as far as the eye can see. This prairie was filled with the scent of flowers and plants. Taking a deep breath here would raise one’s spirit a hundred times and make people relaxed and happy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian was on the run without even bothering to look back. Despite having to drag his wounded body, he didn’t have time to worry about it. He used his greatest speed to flee since this was his last chance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gave chase with considerable agility as well. However, he didn’t go all out since there was no rush to catch up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the hunt, Li Qiye smiled and spoke: “It looks like some people can still endure for a while longer. I wonder what tricks you have left.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice traveled far and wide. Everyone could hear him clearly, including Zhentian up ahead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhentian didn’t dare to reply and kept on desperately running for his life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators behind them were astounded. No one would expect for the day when Zhentian would have to run like a dog that had lost its master. He should be the hunter, not the hunted. The scene today was hard to take in for many people, especially the charming spirit experts.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were the most optimistic about Zhentian and thought that he could kill Li Qiye, but today, it was the complete opposite.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, this escape made many people curious. Where was the Prince of Darkness’ group? Why haven’t they showed themselves to help Zhentian who was running like a dog?</span></p><div id="footnote-9d06"><p>1.
