The entire world was basked in this golden light.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many spectators were stunned to see the golden light oozing from the reflection. No one had seen this type of reflection before, it was simply too bizarre.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” At this moment, it seemed to be opening a new world. One could see its shape within the mirror-like power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within this world lied a chaotic expanse as well as an endless power that came from the origin. It had the ability to open the sky and split the earth, a world-creating power. Perhaps this was the form of the nine worlds with the gathering of all kinds of forces before it was created.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A figure stepped out from this primordial chaos. Each step seemed to be guiding the world towards completion as if it was shouldering myriad realms.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, the chaos was opened and a complete figure came out. A golden man was standing there as if it was the oldest creature in existence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its figure of endless height towered into the sky. People couldn’t even see its face when they looked up due to its monstrous size. This figure looked like the ruler of all ages. A simple gesture from it could create a world. Another would make the nine worlds tremble and quake.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the experts here felt the urge to prostrate. In fact, many of them were already on the ground, especially the charming spirits. The urge to worship was even stronger inside them as if this golden creation possessed their race’s power. It made their eyes brim with tears of excitement.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A charming spirit lying on the ground even murmured: “Is that our progenitor?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could give an answer since they hadn’t seen the charming spirit progenitor before. However, this golden man ahead did give them the feeling of an ancient power from their race. Even if this figure wasn’t their progenitor, it certainly had their progenitor’s power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is that?” Even older charming spirits didn’t know what this existence was.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A legend.” An old God-Monarch from their race paled and murmured: “A legend from the Dream Empyrean. Shen Mengtian might have come from the Spirit Abyss, but he was also blessed by the origin power of our race. This allowed him to have our progenitor’s power. Because of this, he was able to leave the abyss and create his own sect. Who would have thought that after him, Meng Zhentian would also inherit this power? This is too unbelievable.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man felt envious after saying this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The golden man’s chest shot out even more rays that instantly soared towards Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They carried an unstoppable power capable of piercing through Heaven Spirit itself. If there were deities in the nine heavens, these rays would make short work of them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts were stunned to see this attack. It was very overbearing and mighty and seemed as if nothing could stop it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bring it.” Li Qiye laughed in the face of this attack and unleashed a ten fist combination.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under this punch, everything collapsed and returned to the source.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” Loud explosions erupted. His punch and Zhentian’s golden rays finally slammed into each other. It was as if Li Qiye was punching a gigantic meteorite in the form of these rays.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” His combination fist had difficulty stopping the brilliant rays.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t stand still in the face of this offense and was forced back. Even though he had sealed this location, the space beneath his feet still shattered to pieces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a power capable of annihilating space itself. Others would find it difficult to withstand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is way too strong. Only Li Qiye’s invincible fist can do this well against it.” Someone spoke with admiration even though Li Qiye was being pushed back continuously.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Activate!” Li Qiye laughed maniacally.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom!” In this split second, his right hand trembled twice. In the blink of an eye, time emerged with a sacred glimmer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the final two fists, the Eternal and Void Imperfection Fists, came out. The power of time and holiness instantly enveloped his right fist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The combination of all twelve gave birth to a sacred flame around his fist. It seemed to no longer be part of this world and made him look like a high immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” The tide was instantly reversed with this twelve fist combination. It seemed to be cutting through or even reversing time itself. It didn’t only wield every type of force in this world, everything else was passing away with time itself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sacred flame disintegrated the golden light. Earlier, the attacking golden light seemed to be an unstoppable weapon. However, this tool of war dispersed like golden powder as it couldn’t withstand a single blow from Li Qiye’s fist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the initial blast, Li Qiye somehow re-created Zhentian’s golden brilliance then shot it back at him. If Zhentian couldn’t stop this, he would be turned into ashes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people gasped after seeing the attack get reflected back at Zhentian. He himself was aghast and crazily roared: “Suppress!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his shout, his fate palaces flew out one by one.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone started counting and exclaimed: “Ten fate palaces!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t shocking for Zhentian to have ten. For many people, this was a matter of course. After all, he was a brilliant Era Evader, so he should have this many palaces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, having ten palaces was indeed enviable. It was a representative symbol for one’s talents, a badge of proof and a kind of glory.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ten embodies extreme perfection.” The old charming spirit God-Monarch spoke with astonishment: “Such a proud thing to have. If I had ten, no, even nine palaces, I could have become a Godking instead of stopping at the God-Monarch realm.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majority agreed with his sentiment. This was a proud achievement indeed. It made sense that someone like Zhentian was able to become the most amazing genius in Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ten palaces instantly formed a kingdom with a majestic primordial power as if it was its own world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” A large divine reflection appeared within. It was of an unimaginable size and blotted out the sky in the kingdom!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoa!” Everyone was dazzled by this large mirror. This might be the first time anyone has ever seen such a huge divine reflection.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The great reflection in the kingdom fused with Zhentian’s own reflection.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” After this fusion, a huge reflection appeared above him. It was even larger than the sky itself and completely golden in color just like an immeasurable moon!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden man inside the mirror grew several dozen times bigger than before. He must be millions and millions of meters tall, the largest of all in this world.</span></p>
