<p><b>Chapter 1220: Blood Refining All The Teeming Fish</b></p><p>The Jade Sea was obscured by the peacock. It suppressed this entire world; even the top experts were watching this creature in silence.</p><p>In a forbidden ground, an existence woke up and opened its eyes in the abyss, its dry bones radiating divinity.</p><p>The majestic bird horrified all invincible existences. This was an unstoppable offense capable of sweeping through everything.</p><p>“The Peacock Treefather.” Someone muttered in a very distant location.</p><p>At this time, the ancient clans and powerful lineages were nervous with their hair standing on end.</p><p>Even more lineages activated their heavenly mirrors. Many ancestors felt the impulse to kneel while looking at this scene.</p><p>The exceedingly strong ancestors from behemoths like the Golden Isle and Void Imperfection Three Schools were astounded as well.</p><p>A gray-haired ancestor gasped: “Is the treefather coming back to life?”</p><p>The ancestors in this Void Imperfection sect couldn’t believe their eyes and murmured: “No chance. Once a treefather returns to the earth, it should be irreversible.”</p><p>“This is not a resurrection.” The Golden Isle was a treefather lineage, so they knew much more. An ancestor murmured: “This is the treefather showing its spirit. Is it about to extend its life?”</p><p>They knew that it was prohibitively difficult for a treefather to show its spirit. Outside of when their sects were facing imminent doom, they wouldn’t show their spirit even when they were about to wither.</p><p>“I thought I would need to work much harder for the refinement this time… But the Extreme Yang Cauldron and the Law Evading Sword Formation will act as the best alchemy furnace.” Li Qiye smiled while watching this scene.</p><p>“Open!” He shouted. With a buzzing noise, this location lit up. The peacock’s tail suddenly spun in the air.</p><p>An incredible thing happened. With sizzles, all of the frozen Teeming Fish were being erased.</p><p>Their bodies seemed to be under the grinding of a polishing stone and slowly faded away. They could only watch as inches of their flesh were being removed; they couldn’t move or even scream.</p><p>This terrible scene included the members of the Ophidian Tribe, the Dual-Pupils Sect, and their allied lineages. Nearly one hundred thousand disciples from these lineages were slowly being erased.</p><p>In a short period of time, this process continued across the lowest level of foot soldiers to the top paragon high elders, none could escape this fate.</p><p>Eventually, both the fish and cultivators were ground into pools of blood. This was the most precious thing in their bodies — the blood that contained their longevity.</p><p>All of these blood pools came together. Just imagine the sheer amount of accumulated blood from a billion fish. It cemented together into a bloody sea.</p><p>“What…” Those watching through the mirrors were creeped out and trembled. A billion fish were ended just like this.</p><p>“Bang!” The Extreme Yang Cauldron controlled by more than ten high elders suddenly lit up. They had lost control of this great formation.</p><p>“Splash! Splash! Crash!” At this time, Li Qiye took over the Extreme Yang Cauldron. The inexhaustible amount of blood was being fed to it.</p><p>The sunfire within turned into a vortex in order to refine the endless amount of blood. During this process, the high elders inside the formation found their bodies slowly melting away. Their fire of life started to burn and the addition of their blood purified the mass even further.</p><p>“Did you really think that a formation like the Extreme Yang Cauldron could swallow my cauldron fire? How naive. In this world, nothing is purer than the fire of life when it comes to alchemy refinement. Using your fire to refine and nourish the blood for a second time is truly perfect.” Li Qiye refined the sea-like blood using the Extreme Yang Cauldron.</p><p>Eventually, all of the blood was refined and the sea of blood shrunk into a lake. The Extreme Yang Cauldron shattered as well. The high elders had become part of the blood, so they were destroyed as well.</p><p>“Splash—” Li Qiye poured all of the Void Imperfection Water into the Law Avoiding Sword Formation. The high elders from the expanse that set up this formation could only watch themselves being drowned by it.</p><p>“Void Imperfection Water, the supreme sacred aqua of the charming spirits.” Many people were envious to see Li Qiye using so much water to drown out the sword formation. They felt that he was being too wasteful.</p><p>For charming spirits, even a single bottle of this water was extremely precious, but Li Qiye ignored all of that.</p><p>“Clank!” The high elders had lost control of their sword formation. The formation turned into an incomparably holy giant lotus. This was the ultimate form of this formation, capable of purifying and evading everything.</p><p>“Splash!” The Void Imperfection Water turned into a cauldron inside the lotus flower. At this moment, the purifying force of the formation was being pushed to the limit. The recently refined lake of blood was being sucked into this new cauldron.</p><p>The lotus flower closed its petals and the blood was refined once more. Moreover, the high elders stuck inside felt their fate palaces opening. Their spring of life continuously flowed into the cauldron and was being thoroughly refined.</p><p>Their blood energy, longevity blood, and dao force were gathered into their spring of life, and its water continued to pour outside. Their fate ended up being the same as the elders from the Extreme Yang School — slowly melting away.</p><p>Even though this process didn’t look that scary, they were being robbed of everything. It drained their entire being and left behind nothing.</p><p>“Using the fire of life to warm the blood and the water of life to purify it, nothing can be better than this.” Li Qiye smiled while controlling the cauldron: “It would have been too cruel if I had to catch dozens of experts to refine them alive into this medicine, right? Unfortunately, you all didn’t heed my warning and decided to come seek death by turning yourselves into medicine.”</p><p>“The even bigger coincidence is that the Extreme Yang Cauldron and the Law Evading Sword Formation are quite suitable for medicine creation. The merit laws created by your grand completion Immortal Physique users consist of unrivaled hardness and peerless softness. Coming here to be part of my medicine creation, what else can I say? Thank you for helping me save a lot of time.” Li Qiye leisurely explained the process while refining the blood.</p><p>After seeing this, an ancestor from the Void Imperfection School wondered: “Is this really a coincidence?”</p><p>Eventually, the lotus flower withered and the blood was tempered once more. At this time, it no longer looked like blood, its appearance was closer to a treasure liquid. It exuded a wondrous light.</p><p>Earlier, there was a lake of blood, but now this liquid was reduced to the size of a pond. There was primordial chaos lingering inside this pond, as if a world of stars was about to be born within. An entire universe was being gestated.</p><p>“This kind of treasure liquid can really compare to chaos essence.” Many people were salivating while looking at this liquid. Even those without a clue still knew how precious it was.</p><p>This was a liquid refined from a billion Teeming Fish. Its value could only be imagined.</p><p>Li Qiye took out the Heavenvine Calabash and began to cut it. An ordinary golden liquid poured out from inside, releasing a vibrant force of life. Each drop of this golden liquid contained infinite vigor. He added this golden liquid into the pond.</p><p>“Buzz!” The two instantly fused together. At this time, everyone in the Jade Sea could feel a breeze full of exuberant life force hitting them. There seemed to be an extremely vigorous life being born in this pond of water, capable of taking root in the earth!</p><p>Countless existences in the Jade Sea felt the great vitality being created. Even a dying piece of dry wood would have a second spring.</p><p>“He is actually replenishing the life of the Peacock Tree so it can live longer!” An ancestor was dazed in front of their mirror. They finally understood what Li Qiye was trying to do!</p><p>Countless spectators were astounded, some were moved, and many were silenced.</p><p>Prior to this, someone had asked what Li Qiye was trying to do, and he answered truthfully. At that time, many people mocked and snorted at him. They viewed him with disdain and thought that this fool didn’t know his own limits.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
