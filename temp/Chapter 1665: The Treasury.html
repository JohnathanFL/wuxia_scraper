Brother-in-law’s sacrifice had redeemed for my sin. Because of this, after you have regained your body, you still didn’t do anything against Heaven Suppression.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, you still don’t understand and haven’t changed your mind at all. Still the same Gu Zun as before.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why should I?” Gu Zun smiled back: “If I am a bad person, no matter how much I change my mind and become enlightened, I’m still a bad person. It doesn’t change what I have done in the past.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, just the fact that you told Immortal Emperor Ta Kong of the coordinates to Immortal Demon Grotto alone is worthy of a thousand deaths.” Li Qiye nodded seriously.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Li Qiye escaped from the grotto, he worked together with an Immortal Emperor to banish the entrance to this place into a deep spatial zone. Others wouldn’t be able to find the coordinates of this entrance but Gu Zun was aware of this secret. He told Immortal Emperor Ta Kong so that the emperor could find it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s why there is no need to change my mind.” Gu Zun smiled: “I’m a dead man anyway, why bother trying to become a good person? Plus, I might have a chance of winning as a bad person, don’t you think?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye became a bit sentimental after seeing the calm Gu Zun. He smiled and said: “With your talents, you can learn things that even the old emperors can’t. Alas, you couldn’t learn certain positive traits outside of this calmness. It does resemble me quite a bit.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Immortal Emperors aren’t anything to you anyway. Plus, due to your belief of my natural disposition for betrayal, you wouldn’t have trained me to become one anyway regardless of how I have acted. Thus, I have thought clearly about this matter. No need to worry about becoming an Immortal Emperor, there are many other things in life worth pursuing.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you want to imitate and become me.” Li Qiye was clear on this as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In this world, it isn’t my sister who understands me the best, not my brother-in-law either, it is you, your Excellency.” Gu Zun said: “If I can’t become an emperor, then it’s not bad to become the dark hand either. I don’t lack talents and strategies, my dao heart can be polished even further. Though my dao heart is no match for yours, I still think it can’t be weaker than the emperors. With enough time, mine will be as strong as yours.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But you lack two things. Resources and immortality.” Li Qiye chuckled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Your Excellency. However, you have left behind a treasury that was once watched over by my brother-in-law and Immortal Emperor Qian Li. It was then strengthened by Immortal Emperor Yin Tian later. I heard them saying that this treasury contains your personal artifacts for attacking the tenth world. Thus, there is no need to debate their values. If I can obtain them, that’s enough for me to stand strong in the nine worlds!” Gu Zun remained calm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s why you have always wanted it.” Li Qiye didn’t become angry: “Though you couldn’t open it, this led to your second idea. If you had immortality, it would mean endless possibilities and time for strategies. One day, you would be able to get this treasury.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, that’s why I gave the coordinates to Immortal Emperor Ta Kong so that he could invade the place. Unfortunately, this plan wasn’t that successful. If I could become an immortal being like you were, I could replace you one day.” Gu Zun agreed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How interesting.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile: “I have met so many people in the millions of years. Supreme geniuses and treacherous students, but no matter who they are, they all wanted to obtain some treasures or training from me. Of course, becoming an emperor was many people’s dream. However, very few wanted to become an existence like me. Immortality isn’t all that wonderful like in people’s imagination.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s indeed the case.” Gu Zun said solemnly: “This is something I admire about you. As generations went by with pain, you didn’t become a saint or a devil, your heart remained the same. This is the greatest thing about you and what I aspire with great confidence to have one day, an immovable dao heart. Then I can rule the nine worlds just like you, much more interesting than becoming an emperor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not a bad thought, unfortunately, you are not me.” Li Qiye shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s why I have worked hard to become someone like you. After all, my cultivation is still weak after just three generations, not being able to reign the nine worlds just yet. It looks like I have let you down.” Gu Zun replied truthfully.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it, no need to talk about this.” Li Qiye shook his head: “My main goal this time in the Grand Sea is taking your life. Since you have chosen on walking the dark path, I shall let you use all your means and ace cards now, so that you won’t be dying a regretful death.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you. Let us finish this matter then.” Gu Zun respectfully cupped his fist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The entire field was locked the moment Gu Zun finished speaking. An iron curtain surrounded the whole place with the two and the palace inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye wasn’t afraid at all. He carefully observed the curtain and commented: “Flawless craftsmanship, cast from the iron of the earth vein. It grew together with the vein and after a long period of gestation, it had taken roots with the vein for symbiosis.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is all thanks to your guidance.” Gu Zun didn’t become complacent: “You have taught me the art of smelting before so I gave it a try. I’m glad you’re not disappointed.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You still want me to open the treasury.” Li Qiye glanced at the palace and understood Gu Zun’s intention.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I truly want to widen my horizon. Your treasury has been here for a long time. After careful rumination, this treasury was now connected with the earth vein. Without your key, it is impossible to open it. So, I used the arts you have taught me back then and used the earth iron as the base in order to connect this curtain with the earth vein as well. After years of harmonization, my experiment was a success.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm, indeed.” Li Qiye agreed: “A very clever design. If I want to leave by breaking down this curtain, I have to open the treasury first. Or, just opening the treasury would automatically remove the curtain as well. This is indeed the finest craftsmanship in the nine worlds. This technique, this planning, this refinement technique… how many people can actually achieve this type of symbiosis with the earth vein?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If outsiders were to listen to this conversation, they would think the two were discussing a profound art. Who would think that these two were about to kill each other?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Zun respectfully cupped his fist at the praise again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and looked at Gu Zun: “You want to see the key, right?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Gu Zun nodded: “Your treasury is unique, the other treasures in the world are mere scraps in comparison. I have coveted your treasury for a long time, you won’t be so stingy as to not let me see it?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Zun didn’t try to hide his intent at all. There was no need to do so before Li Qiye since nothing could elude his eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you not afraid of me killing you first?” Li Qiye teased.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Zun didn’t become afraid: “I know you’re not so ordinary. In your eyes, I am a dead man, it is only a matter of time. I haven’t used my ace card so you won’t be killing me just yet. I’m confident you will open the treasury first.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How fun.” Li Qiye praised: “Fine, since you want it so bad, what else can I say? It’s not like I can’t let you see it, but, the key is not on me.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From what I know about you, Your Excellency, as long as your soul and sea of memories are there, it will not be a problem. Your sea of memories isn’t only empowered by brother-in-law’s group but also by many other existences. Because of this, it can easily open this treasury.” Gu Zun slowly commented.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gently shook his head: “No, you don’t understand. What I’m saying is, the key is not on me. You have the key.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, your joke isn’t funny at all. If I had the key, I wouldn’t need to wait till now.” Gu Zun shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To which Li Qiye responded in a serious manner: “I’m not joking around. I don’t have the key, the real key has always been on you. You, yourself, is the key.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible!” Gu Zun couldn’t remain calm at this moment. He took one step back with his eyes narrowing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this split second, he came up with a frightening possibility!</span></p>
