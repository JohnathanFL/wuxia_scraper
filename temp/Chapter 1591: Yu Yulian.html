There were only three people who could leave their shadows on the tenth step - Dingyuan Hou, Ye Jiuzhou, and Wolong Zi!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zi was the youngest among the three but also the first to die while the other two were unstoppable and influential Godkings.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some said that if Wolong Zi were still alive, his future achievements wouldn’t be inferior to the other two. All eyes fell upon the eleventh step now with its one shadow. It meant that only one person has climbed up to this level before.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The discussion stopped when someone quietly stated: “Princess Yu is here.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They quickly turned around and saw a young woman approaching. With her white dress, she looked like a lotus blossoming on the water surface. This was a beautiful woman with luminous and seductive eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Yu.” Many quickly rushed forward to greet her. They were quite friendly since some aimed for flattery. Of course, some of them had a crush on her too.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Yulian was very famous among the young generation of the Grand Sea, a highly sought-after lady.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m here today to test it out and didn’t expect to see so much support. Thank you, everyone.” She said slowly with a touch of shyness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re too reserved. Princess, to be able to see your ascension is our honor.” One youth said with haste: “Our Majesty once said that you are the heavenly daughter of the contemporary, standing shoulder to shoulder with Heaven Suppression Goddess and Sky Dragon King, one of our three great beauties.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This youth came from the Mu Zhuo’s Demon City and was Golden Dragon Prince’s martial nephew. His self-chosen title was Peacock Prince. His flattery act wasn’t for himself but rather the Golden Dragon Prince.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince had wanted to propose to the Yu Clan for Yu Yulian. However, this was put aside due to Taijun’s emergence. Because of this, the Peacock Prince wanted to use this opportunity to put in good words for his uncle.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No way, the Golden Dragon Prince is too kind.” She smiled and said, quite pleased with the comment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that Wolong Xuan and Zi Cuining were at the top of the young generation on top of being extremely beautiful. Yu Yulian naturally couldn’t compare to these two.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, many wanted to flatter the Yu Clan so they placed her on the same level as the other two. She was very willing to hear these praises while feeling very smug inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the moon surrounded by the stars, she walked towards the twelve scales with her eyes fixated on the man alone on the eleventh step.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Long’s temperament is matchless in history. He will definitely become emperor.” A strange glimmer flashed in her eyes. She didn’t try to hide her adoration at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young cultivators here also looked up at the shadow above.

Even those who liked Yulian couldn’t help but sigh. They became gloomy because this young man was supreme indeed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Emperor Long is indeed unique in this generation. When our king became sworn-brother with him, our king said that he will become Immortal Emperor.” The Peacock Prince who was a demon pheasant said with admiration.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, who can compete with Brother Long nowadays? He will be victorious for sure!” Yulian’s eyes stared lovingly at the shadow and wanted nothing more than to jump into its embrace as she said: “He already has a grand completion Immortal Physique.” She revealed an intoxicating smile at this point.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Young Emperor Long could even slay a Nine Worlds’ Godking.

Nevertheless, they could only express this annoyance quietly.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-49a7">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Members of the crowd were stirred to hear this name. It was too overwhelming and powerful in the Grand Sea. He had many young fans as well with countless noble daughters and princesses.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being the successor of the Soaring Immortal Sect, he was destined for greatness and excellence! His cultivation didn’t shame his background since he had a grand completion Immortal Physique already. Furthermore, his current level was at Emperor Candidate, only lacking the recognition of the Heaven’s Will.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The news was so shocking since he was already a grand completion user when he showed himself to the world with the strength of a candidate. He would be the magnificent son of the heavens, the object of countless praises and love.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shall become the unbeatable master in this generation.

After meeting and talking to him the first time, I can see that scene already, when he fought against the world alone for ten days and nights without tasting defeat.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-8ae0"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her complexion had a peachy color after saying this. Her heart rapidly bumped with the resurfacing memories. She fell in love with him at first sight and wanted nothing more than being his woman even without any official title.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-8ae0">[2]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people who had a crush on her didn’t have an easy time looking at her current appearance but they didn’t say anything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was stirred with her message. The Peacock Prince had to admit: “Young Emperor Long challenged the heroes of the world and killed five Godkings in a row. Even the strongest Nine Worlds’ Godking, Hai Guai, was taken down too. He’s the only one who can have such a battle record.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right, the Denary King can take on the whole world, that’s an unparalleled feat!” The others quickly parroted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some weren’t too happy about the praises so they quietly scowled. After the Soaring Immortal Sect descended, they took up a sea region. Its inhabitants were naturally unhappy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, they weren’t the nice crowd either.

If any sect was unconvinced, they could challenge him. If he were to lose, then not only would Soaring Immortal leave the Grand Sea instantly, they would also compensate for all the losses with Immortal Emperors’ manuals and weapons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, everyone’s attention was grabbed by these treasures.
