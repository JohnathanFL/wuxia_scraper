Even invincible characters like them were slack-jawed and thought they had misheard him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they understood that this was no mistake since Li Qiye has indeed raised his finger. It was indeed one move!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible!” Both the experts watching from their mirrors and the masters actually present by the cliff blurted out after confirming Li Qiye’s intention.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They simply refused to accept that he was going to use one move against Divine Ancestor Driedtree. This must be a daydream; maybe it was possible for an emperor, but definitely not a junior like Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driedtree thought he was insane and reiterated: “You are certain that you can slay me with one move?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, just one to kill you.” Li Qiye firmly answered with a carefree smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One more confirmation let the crowd know that Li Qiye was serious.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shortly after, the world was void of sound. Even his opponents were completely speechless since they shared the same sentiments as the spectators. However, Li Qiye seemed so sure of himself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha!” Driedtree was livid and laughed: “One move to kill me? Hahaha, this is the most arrogant thing I’ve ever heard in my life. Who do you think you are?! Killing me with one move!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He went insane from anger and wanted nothing more than to annihilate this foe before him. He could restrain the disdainful act from Li Qiye earlier since he had to maintain his style as a master; there was no need to be picky towards a junior or it would harm his image.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, his fury ran wild. Remember that he was considered an Emperor Assailant, one of the strongest characters in Heaven Spirit. However, a junior just claimed that he could beat him in just one move. Being treated like an ant by a junior — this was beyond his tolerance. Thus, laughing was the only response he had from being too furious.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Li Qiye who will kill you in one move. I hope you can remember my name before death.” Li Qiye nonchalantly smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words came easily, but no other statement could be more domineering and shocking!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driedtree stopped laughing because he realized that Li Qiye wasn’t joking around.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest of the group was stirred as well. Could Li Qiye really take down Driedtree in just one move?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He coldly uttered: “Junior, no one can do so outside of Immortal Emperors, and it has to be a move empowered by the Heaven’s Will. That might be able to take me down in one move. Even their ordinary attacks can’t do so.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t an unreasonable statement because even if he wasn’t a real Emperor Assailant, a casual attack from an emperor shouldn’t be able to take him down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the people present weren’t real assailants. At the very least, their cultivation and personal strength weren’t at this level. For example, Driedtree was quite powerful, but he had some fatal flaws. This was the reason why he couldn’t become a treefather.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Stygian, if he used his progenitor’s weapon, he could fight against an emperor for one to two hundred moves. However, his own abilities alone wouldn’t allow him to do so at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Fengyun was the most powerful here. His cultivation was at the Legendary Godking level. Alas, his grand dao was imperfect and incomplete — this was his weakness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, rumor has it that he didn’t borrow any external power and still fought against Immortal Emperor Hao Hai for several hundred moves. Thus, his power was widely recognized.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outsiders might think that Stygian and his group were Emperor Assailants, but the real masters looked down on their title. In their eyes, Stygian’s group was not qualified to be considered assailants.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Fengyun was the only exception. Even if he was a bit weaker than real assailants, he came from a small sect and reached his current level with his own unyielding determination. Thus, the real masters recognized his achievements.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All in all, even if Driedtree wasn’t a real assailant, he simply didn’t believe that Li Qiye could take him down in one move since even emperors couldn’t do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You only have the power of a Nine Worlds’ Godking, yet you think you’re a real assailant?” Li Qiye chuckled and lightly said: “Even with the treefather’s seal from birth that empowers you, allowing you to be a little stronger than an ordinary Nine Worlds’ Godking, you’re still only a Nine Worlds’ Godking. Since you’re not even a Legendary Godking, one move is more than enough.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s a Legendary Godking?” Many juniors have never heard of this title before, so they had to ask their ancestors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A peak Godking.” The oldest ancestor of a sect put on a solemn expression: “Legend states that this is the real realm to be an Emperor Assailant. People do say that long ago, Ling Fengyun became a Legendary Godking. Who knows if this is true or not?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driedtree shouted: “Even if I’m not a Legendary Godking, I can still take you on.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driedtree didn’t know where to put his old face after Li Qiye revealed his background. For people of their level, being called an Emperor Assailant was a supreme glory.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the world knew that Immortal Emperors were untouchable. Being able to assail one was a great achievement. Even losing to them after a confrontation was prestigious. This was enough for the world to sing praises about them for a generation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he has never fought with an emperor before, this title gave him glee and glory. However, this source of pride of his was trampled upon by Li Qiye’s spiel. How could he not become angry?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, one move.” Li Qiye ignored his face and casually smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, good! I want to see how you will kill me in one move!” Driedtree laughed maniacally.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he went out to fight, Dualchild immediately pulled him back: “Brother, wait or you’ll fall for his little trap.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think too highly of yourselves. There’s no need for me to resort to traps to deal with your group.” Li Qiye countered with a grin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dualchild was still calm and stared at Li Qiye: “Li Qiye, do you dare to make a bet? What if you can’t kill Brother Driedtree?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driedtree immediately regained his wits after being stopped by Dualchild. He sneered and said: “That’s right. Junior, what will you do?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you want to be tricky.” Li Qiye smiled: “Don’t you want the nine leaves? Fine, if I can’t kill you in one move, the leaves shall be yours!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driedtree loudly emphasized: “Really now?!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye’s opponents couldn’t believe it. They didn’t think he could kill Driedtree at all so they had no problem letting him try. Plus, this was a chance for them to use Driedtree in order to see Li Qiye’s real killing moves.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will do as I say.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Don’t worry. If I can’t kill you, not just one leaf but the entire thing will be yours.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was slightly moved, including Dualchild since he was also here for the leaves. He even wanted to participate in this bet, but since Driedtree was first in line, he wasn’t in a position to contend with him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, you said it.” Driedtree suddenly became excited. In his mind, he could obtain the grass with Li Qiye’s failure — this was completely worth it. Ultimately, this is predicated on him being confident that Li Qiye wouldn’t be able to kill him in one move!</span></p>
