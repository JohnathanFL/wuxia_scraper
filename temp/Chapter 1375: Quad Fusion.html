Bang!” As Terra was being burned by the sunfire, the battles nearby became quite exciting as well. Heavy blows were traded resoundingly. Resplendent had been struck more than ten times by the ambushing Void Devil, causing him to vomit blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was furious under the constant sneak attacks, yet he couldn’t retaliate due to the stealthy nature of this avatar.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Resplendent crazily roared: “You court death!” His blood energy turned bright red as if it was burning. In a split second, his power rose greatly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” He was burning his blood energy, so a visual phenomenon emerged behind him in the form of a blue sky. There was a stalwart figure standing below this sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His divine hammer audibly resonated with this great figure as a terrifying aura surged to the sky. It seemed to be coming back to life. Long and narrow laws of five different colors emerged. A divine aura pervaded the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great figure’s eyes suddenly lit up and seemed to be illuminating the world. Nothing could evade its gaze.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this?” Many people were shocked to see the divine weapon coming back to life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A paragon understood what was going on and explained: “He’s burning his bloodline to reach an atavistic state, allowing him to summon his ancestor’s totem. This ancestor was a true god, so this is the totem of his bloodline.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the last resort for Resplendent. Burning his bloodline required him to pay a great price, but there was nothing else he could do. Being beaten by the avatar of a junior made him lose all face. If he didn’t beat Li Qiye today, he would lose all of his reputation as a Godking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” In a split second, the Diamond God attacked without dodging. The grand dao exploded with its punches.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Scram!” Resplendent was much stronger this time as he roared and slammed down his divine hammer with a force capable of shattering the universe and its myriad laws. A Grand Godking would be annihilated instantly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The attack didn’t just contain the power of a Heavenly Godking from Resplendent, it also had the might of a true god. The Diamond God simply couldn’t stop this destructive blow. Its body was flattened and hit the ground, causing cracks to appear.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a scene shocked the crowd. The spectators felt pain from their bodies. If they were struck by the same blow, their bodies would go up in smoke.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The Void Devil joined the fray and delivered a palm attack to Resplendent’s chest. However, Resplendent simply shook his shoulders, suffering zero injuries.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” The figure shot out a visual attack right away and sealed the Void Devil.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Void had melted into space, so this particular seal couldn’t stop it. Nevertheless, its speed of disappearance was affected; it was much slower.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Resplendent was prepared for this and grasped the opportunity. The divine hammer swung by. With continuous banging noises, it slammed into Void like a storm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Void managed to escape under the totem’s brilliance. A bit later, it appeared at a different location while staggering backward. Cracks emerged on its body as if it was on the verge of shattering.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pa!” At this time, the Diamond God jumped out of the mud pit. Despite being flattened into a disk, it had regained its form without the slightest injury.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone gasped to see that it was fine and well after taking that attack capable of killing a Heavenly Godking.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Resplendent was confident this time and laughed: “Ignorant child, release all of your avatars. I will kill all of them today.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still believed that these were Li Qiye’s avatars, so he wasn’t afraid of facing all of them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed back in response and said: “There’s no need for all of them just to deal with you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A majestic blood energy rushed out of the kingdom and poured into Void.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.” A wave of hums resounded. Void accepted this majestic power that healed the cracks, ridding it of its injuries.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scraps of the Myriad Thoughts Pot that Li Qiye obtained from the Buddhist Funeral Plateau were too little and couldn’t possibly be turned into twelve iron men. Therefore, he refined the scraps into a single iron man before cultivating it with the blood energy inside his kingdom. In this fashion, the single man eventually turned into twelve.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t so easy to destroy something that came from this pot. Li Qiye required the flame from the green lamp and all of his efforts before being able to refine them. Thus, for the twelve deities, they would only be forced back to their original forms at best. It was simply impossible to destroy them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These blows from the divine hammer were able to crack them without causing any real damage. Even if they were struck by a true ultimate blow, they would only turn back to their little iron man form.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a bit different for the Diamond God. Due to its physique, it could withstand unbelievable attacks. Breaking through this particular defense was exceedingly difficult. Unlike Void, it didn’t need the blood energy from the kingdom to treat its wounds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang!” Two more avatars came out of the kingdom of blood. One had fairy-like wings and exuded a wondrous light. These radiating wings seemed to be able to prop up an immortal world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Soaring Immortal God. The other was a devil. It stood there in an immovable fashion. Regardless of its location, no one could get past it. This was something capable of suppressing the heavens and all gods and devils. Its name was the Hell Suppressing Devil.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoist Puresun murmured to himself: “It’s the Soaring Immortal and Hell Suppressing Physiques this time?” He finally understood what the twelve avatars consisted of.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was anxious to see two more come out. They had already seen just how powerful Diamond and Void were. It was easy to imagine how many foes Li Qiye could take down by utilizing the twelve deities.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come. Even if you let them all out, I’ll still make quick work out of them.” Since Resplendent had already burned his bloodline, he crazedly laughed and thought that he might as well go all out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye showed an insipid smile: “Four is enough to tear you to pieces.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” The four deities stood together this time. Their individual radiances was blinding; it was either a wondrous light or a monstrous evil flame.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zzz—” Next came an incredible development. The four deities actually fused as if they were molten iron and turned into a new deity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Its brilliance erupted in a split second. It was half devil and half god. Three thousand worlds floated within it along with myriad celestials.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The sound of a weapon resonating rang in this particular deity. It exuded a metallic glow that was sharp and cold as well as a murderous aura unique to a weapon. There were no emotions or flesh, the deity itself was a weapon!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This isn’t an Immortal Physique or an avatar, it's just a weapon!” Puresun finally saw through its mysteries. He realized that his prior speculations were false.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ruthless murderous intent was the nature of a weapon. Puresun felt a cold chill while looking at this metallic luster from the deity. He was more knowledgeable and insightful compared to everyone else present. He realized many things after seeing this weapon, that Li Qiye didn’t only have all twelve Immortal Physiques, he also possessed their true mysticisms! This was someone who could collect all of them at grand completion!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Across the eras, how many people had perfect mastery over all twelve physiques at the same time? The answer was zero!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” This deity headed straight for Resplendent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” The totem behind Resplendent lit up as he crazily burned his own blood. Another hammer to decapitate the heavens went straight for the incoming deity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The deity didn’t try to dodge at all and continued its offense.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The hammer slammed on its body, but it was completely untouched. On the contrary, this divine hammer was sent flying to the horizon from the impact.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The deity reached out its right hand and immediately pierced Resplendent’s chest to rip out his heart.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thump! Thump! Thump!” Resplendent retreated several steps back with his eyes wide open to look at his still-beating heart that had been pulled out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” As Resplendent was screaming, the deity tore his body in half. Blood spurted and his innards fell to the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such overbearing ferocity. A Heavenly Godking had just been torn apart in one move while screaming for his life — this scene left the crowd dumbfounded.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Too weak.” Li Qiye emotionlessly commented while his deity threw Resplendent’s corpse to the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Puresun felt a chill after watching this. A weapon fused with four Immortal Physiques was truly frightening! What if all twelve fused? The result would be simply unimaginable.</span></p>
