<p><b>Chapter 1159: Golden Isle Lord</b></p><p>The isle master paid special attention to Li Qiye. On the next day, he came to visit Li Qiye.</p><p>This was enough to show how much the isle valued a groom like him. After all, a great lineage like this normally wouldn’t act in such a way.</p><p>It was built on two treefathers, meaning that it was equal to a lineage with two Immortal Emperors. However, remember how treefathers would return to the earth and the origin to protect their descendants? This meant that a lineage like the frightening isle had even more resources and power than a dual emperors lineage.</p><p>The personal visit from the isle lord was giving more than enough face for Li Qiye.</p><p>“Ah, Virtuous Nephew’s entrance to my Golden Isle was truly a spectacle; you and my daughter are truly a match made in heaven.” The isle lord happily smiled after seeing Li Qiye: “I heard our disciples say that your entry was a complete coincidence. This simply means that this marriage is the will of the heavens, a preordained romance that will become a wonderful tale across the Heaven Spirit World!”</p><p>Li Qiye smiled in response while staring at the isle lord: “It’s a bit strange to hear you put it that way. I’m more like a captive stallion, ready to mate at any time to produce more offspring.”</p><p>The isle lord burst out into laughter and replied: “Being qualified to be a stallion is also a type of capital; not just anyone can be a stallion no matter how much they desire it. We can also take a step back and say that being a stallion of our Golden Isle is not a shameful thing at all. We won’t talk about other stuff, but Virtuous Nephew will have no lack of riches here.”</p><p>The isle lord was being very frank and honest. In fact, there was no need for any trickery. With the isle’s status and power, they would look down on lying to Li Qiye.</p><p>“Then I suppose I should be thanking you for your honesty.” Li Qiye smiled leisurely.</p><p>The isle lord took another look at Li Qiye. This was an ordinary looking fella. If it wasn’t for the examination by their formation, he would find it difficult to believe that such a normal looking young man had the bloodline at the level of an imperial prince.</p><p>However, after a quick word with him, the lord truly believed that this person had a powerful bloodline. He might look ordinary, but his responses and demeanor were far from it.</p><p>Anyone would be ecstatic and jump happily after becoming the groom of Golden Isle. They would either start feeling smug and conceited or act bashfully out of apprehension of their status.</p><p>However, this youth was completely nonchalant and natural. He was at ease, regardless of whether he wanted to become the groom or that he was facing the island’s lord.</p><p>It seemed that neither being the groom and talking to the isle lord could cause any waves in his mind, that it wasn’t enough for him to care. Such a person must have experienced countless storms and have a determined dao heart.</p><p>The isle lord smilingly stated: “I believe that when Virtuous Nephew and my daughter live together, you two will become a dao pair that garners the envy of many people in this world.”</p><p>Li Qiye gently shook his head and responded in a cordial manner: “Isle Lord has such confidence? To be frank, do you think that I will definitely marry your daughter? I know some of the conventions in the Heaven Spirit World. For many lineages, they would have started looking for a stallion the moment a powerful bloodline appears.”</p><p>“I know full well that these powerful lineages have many stallions that have been groomed for a long time. Outside of allowing the pair to get to know each other, it also cultivates loyalty and dedication.” Li Qiye glanced at the isle lord and said with a smile: “But now, your sect is choosing from outsiders, this is quite interesting…”</p><p>“Everything will change with time, and conventions are no exceptions.” The isle lord maintained his smile.</p><p>Li Qiye went on: “Whether it is picking the right stallion or choosing the correct cauldron, in terms of humans, I know the best choices are at the Exquisite Valley. It is the place with exceptional human bloodlines, so it would make more sense for your Golden Isle to cooperate with them.”</p><p>The isle lord smiled: “The world is vast, it is not certain that the Exquisite Valley will have the greatest bloodlines. Virtuous Nephew is someone like that. Your bloodline surpasses all of the bloodlines there. In fact, it is worthy of pride no matter where you go, whether it be the Heaven Spirit World or the rest of the nine worlds.”</p><p>The Exquisite Valley was the largest human lineage in this world. Its strength was unbelievably mighty and it had two brilliant aspects. The first was their beautiful appearances and the other was their great bloodlines.</p><p>It was also the sect that had the most relationships with other sects and powers in the Heaven Spirit World.</p><p>On top of this, it had the most dashing males and beautiful females. Of course, this was putting things tactfully. To be frank, it was a place that produced stallions and cultivation incubators. [2. Incubators here are females.]</p><p>It had the finest and most comprehensive bloodlines of the human race, making them suitable for any other race and lineage.</p><p>There was an ongoing joke. If one couldn’t find a suitable husband or wife at the Exquisite Valley, then they wouldn’t be able to find one at all in the nine worlds and were doomed to live a single life till old.</p><p>Although it was a joke, it did show just how excellent and plentiful the bloodlines were at the valley.</p><p>Because of this, many main successors and daughters of the lineages here were very welcoming of men and women from the valley to be their live-in partner. [3. Live-in partner here is a concept mainly for grooms. They would go live with their wife’s family instead and the children would not carry their last name. It is a shameful thing.]</p><p>Due to the inter-marriage relationships, the valley had ties with many lineages in the Heaven Spirit World, allowing them to have a matchless number of connections.</p><p>Li Qiye laughed after hearing this: “Please don’t flatter me so much or I’ll feel so elated that I’ll have to say yes to you.”</p><p>The isle lord immediately said with a smile: “This can’t be considered flattery. Your constitution truly deserves such praise.”</p><p>Li Qiye leisurely answered: “But Isle Lord still hasn’t answered my question.”</p><p>The isle lord was still all smiles: “Nephew worries too much. The valley is indeed an excellent lineage and worthy of admiration regardless of the generation.”</p><p>“I see.” Li Qiye smirked and slowly said: “Your daughter’s bloodline is absolutely matchless. It contains something amazing, so you all don’t want to form ties with the valley. After all, with such an incredible lineage, why involve the valley and share it?”</p><p>“Moreover, you will even take an imperial level bloodline like me in. This means that you have great confidence in your own bloodline. Or perhaps my bloodline will be able to support hers. From this, Golden Isle might have a heaven-defying child in the future.” He stared directly at the isle lord at this point.</p><p>The lord only laughed out loud in response: “Nephew is overthinking things. We’re only making a minor change, it is no secret at all.”</p><p>“Fine, if Isle Lord does not wish to say it, I won’t push the issue.” Li Qiye smiled back: “However, I’m really not interested in this marriage at all, if we can call it that. I’m not willing to be your breeding stallion.”</p><p>The lord glanced at him quickly and said: “Our Golden Isle will not force such a thing onto Nephew, but you should know that forming a strong alliance rings true no matter the occasion. If you are willing to stay… there’s no need for me to explain all the benefits. As for other things, we can talk about it in detail.”</p><p>The lord was indeed showing enough sincerity and goodwill. It was a clear indication of how important he deemed Li Qiye’s bloodline to be.</p><p>Li Qiye was quite amused by this treatment as he chortled: “Even before taking my opinion into account, don’t you think this type of groom selection is too hasty? Will your daughter agree to having a random husband that appeared out of nowhere? I trust that no girl wouldn’t oppose this. Isle Lord is a smart person, I’m sure you know that in order to have a successful marriage with the aim of reproduction and strengthening your bloodline, the parties involved still need to like each other. This would be the best case scenario. There is no force greater than the word ‘love’, it is both a poison and panacea.”</p><p>Stallions, incubators, and bloodlines were extremely precious. If there was a loss to either of the parties, then it would be a loss to the entire sect.</p><p>It was best that the man and woman liked each other so that they could reproduce and strengthen a bloodline. Because of this, the two would normally meet each other at a very young age. Their relationship would then develop to become a pillar for their emotional attachment in the future.</p><p>The powerful lineages usually wouldn’t suddenly pick a stallion or incubator. Most would be groomed from a young age. Thus, Golden Isle’s action this time contained a mystery that no one else knew about.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
