It burned everything in the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawr.” The great shadow of nine supremes from the Divine Beast Zither descended in the form of a Heavenly Annihilation!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Everything fell into the darkness and was devoured.

This insane attack could destroy everything in this world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reason why the World Seal and Li Qiye were such a devastating duo. When his thirteen palaces and the seal worked together, they could unleash an endless number of annihilations.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, this was only using a butcher’s blade to kill a chicken. It couldn’t even be considered a warm-up, just a little bit of fun. This was the fruit of his recent cultivation achievements, a new understanding of the fate palaces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is he trying to destroy the world?” Even God-Monarchs dropped to the ground, unable to withstand this pressure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other experts were twitching on their back.

Nevertheless, he reacted quickly by activating his Soaring Immortal Physique to its limit, evident by his shining body. At the same time, his weapons also exuded their bright lights.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” His two annihilations couldn’t withstand the swift onslaught and collapsed instantly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his weapons spewed out a divine tsunami of brilliance. They rushed forward and turned into the most fortified wall in this world to stop the incoming annihilations. Even a Legendary Godking couldn’t break through this wall.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, his physique was at its fastest state and the Virtuous Sword was protecting him.

They actually gave chase through time and space across the sky. Despite being quite far away, he was still struck by the remnant blasts of the annihilation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” He was blown away to a different spatial sphere and through another one in an instant.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with the protection of the armor and the Virtuous Sword, blood still gushed outward.

To be able to unleash so many Heavenly Annihilations without any visible fatigue on his vitality was simply unstoppable. Maybe an emperor would be able to stop him but Godkings were no longer significant.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So boring using&nbsp;annihilations.” Li Qiye recalled the World Seal and said with disinterest.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd felt like cicada during the winter. They became afraid and felt despair. For many people, they could try their whole life and wouldn’t be able to unleash one Heavenly Annihilation. Long Aotian was already incredible to be able to use two in succession. This could be considered a miracle.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when Li Qiye unleashed so many with ease, it made everyone else lose hope. Fiercest just needed to use eight or ten annihilations and no imperial lineage would be able to withstand it!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aotian could be referred to as a timeless genius by using just two but he was nothing compared to Fiercest who could throw them out like cabbages.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The successor to Soaring Immortal is a little weak.” Li Qiye shook his head and quietly disappeared among the vast ocean.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This statement made even more people drop to the ground.

This was quite extraordinary, winning him the title of the number one genius of the demon race at the Grand Sea. Hai Lin was amazing as well for being able to escape time and time again from Long Aotian.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these geniuses were smiling helplessly.

No, he might even surpass them to be the Eternal Prime Emperor.”&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-0508">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Weak.” Godkings were lost in forlorn after hearing Fiercest’s evaluation of Aotian: “I wish I could be considered a ‘weak’ person in Fiercest’s eyes.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that Aotian wasn’t weak at all, especially when he could use two annihilations at the same time.
