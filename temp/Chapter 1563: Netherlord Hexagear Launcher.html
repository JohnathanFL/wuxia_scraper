Meanwhile, Heaven Suppression City had a monster that reigned for three generations. It was full of experts like lairs of dragons and tigers. The nine worlds trembled during the Black Dragon King’s era.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the two sects joined forces, all the nine worlds would tremble, not just the Mortal Emperor World. Who could actually stop such an invincible alliance?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gu Zun?” Li Qiye chuckled. Others might not know what this guy was up to but Li Qiye&nbsp;did. After so many years, Gu Zun was finally tempted into revealing his fangs.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wolong Xuan quietly leaned on his shoulder without dwelling on this matter. There was no doubt that Li Qiye was prepared for this so no need to waste words.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Li, why did you come to the Grand Sea?” She eventually opened her pretty eyes and asked him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t just visit? I’m not necessarily someone who only comes for a reason.” He said in response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But that’s exactly who you are. You’re not idle enough to go around needlessly. Furthermore, this place is only a desolate island and you picked it out of all places. I don’t believe you’re here for no reason.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My beautiful Xuan, you are quite discerning.” He touched her nose and said: “You are right, I’m here with a goal in mind.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s special about these islands?” She sat upright and looked around.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, she didn’t see what was particular about them despite being attentive the moment she got here due to her suspicion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not this island. The entire Crouching Dragon Mountain Range is special.” Li Qiye stood up and smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our mountain range?” She was surprised to hear this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This mountain range was the largest on their continent and spanned for a million miles! It was the main vein of their continent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded. His fate palaces opened with clanking noises as laws emerged.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” Nailing noises resounded. A golden law resembling a divine chain pinned deep into the soil.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” A complete chapter with many floating runes appeared in the soil and instantly rose to Li Qiye’s height.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pushed it down with his right hand. With the movement of his hand, the runes re-arranged themselves before disappearing again. Next, a large plate appeared in his palm, seemingly cast from some ancient bronze metal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The plate fell to the ground and disappeared into the earth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this second, the entire earth quaked with tsunamis ravaging the ocean as if a gigantic creature was turning underground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” A portal around the size of a window appeared on the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it opened, an extremely majestic aura of the world oozed out. It was completely endless and thick, almost taking a liquid form.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The opening of this portal made the essences in the deepest region of the world ooze out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the worldly essence of the Crouching Dragon Vein!” Xuan cultivated at the cliff since youth. Her sect had control of this particular earth vein so she was very familiar with this essence energy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She became dazed and said: “You… you have opened a hole in the vein!” Keep in mind that their ancestral ground was built at the end of this particular vein. Logically, only their sect could truly control this energy but this didn’t seem to be the case right now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct.” He chuckled and reached into the portal. It gave the illusion that he was reaching into the deepest location in the earth. The greatest mysteries couldn’t hide from him; all were within his grasp.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” The continent quaked again to the dismay of the experts. Even the cliff didn’t know what was going on.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wolong Xuan felt something was being ruthlessly dragged out by Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Finally, he took out an item from the portal. It was shrouded in primordial energy that wouldn’t disperse. This item seemed to have been gestating with this energy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The portal disappeared right after and the worldly energy disappeared as well. Everything returned to normality outside of the extra item in his possession.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You took something from our Crouching Dragon Mountain Range!” She blurted out in shock.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To be more precise, I took back something I hid there.” He carefully looked at the item and smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You hid it there and used the earth vein to gestate it!” She knew what was going on instantly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her shock was understandable. Their cliff was the master of this continent and had a great understanding of the mountain range. But now, they were completely ignorant of someone hiding a treasure in their territory.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be surprised, there are many things you don’t know in this world.” He said flatly: “This earth vein is very special and plus, it didn’t belong to your cliff in the past. Furthermore, using an earth vein to incubate a treasure isn’t rare at all.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She eventually calmed down and took a deep breath. This man was too terrible to hide a treasure there for many generations without being detected by her sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is it?” She took her time looking at the item and curiously asked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The primordial chaos surrounding it was still dispersing slowly. She could finally see its shape after all of this energy were gone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a bronze tube around three feet long and as thick as a large bowl. A faint glimmer flashed on the surface but it wasn’t made from a single piece of bronze. It was created from a series of precise and exquisite gears. Upon closer inspection, these gears formed six bigger gears embedded together to shape this perfect tube.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-41c9"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a deep groove on one end of the tube.

It was more accurate to call it a complex work of art than a treasure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Netherlord Hexagear Launcher.” He patted the item with great satisfaction. He has spent a lot of effort and resources in order to cast this weapon. Finally, after millions of years gestating in the earth vein, it has finally come out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Netherlord Hexagear Launcher?” She has never heard of this name before.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need to think, the world has never seen this weapon before.” He chuckled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What can this thing do?” She inquired.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Slay gods and devils.” He answered flatly: “One shot alone can turn your continent into ashes!”</span></p><div id="footnote-41c9"><p>1. I’m pretty sure this is describing a cannon. Tong 筒 &nbsp;means tube but a Huo Jian Tong 火箭筒 means rocket launcher or bazooka. I was thinking of naming it cannon but launcher is the safer word.
