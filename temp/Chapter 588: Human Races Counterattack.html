<p><b>Chapter 588: Human Race’s Counterattack</b></p><p>It was difficult for others to join this battle unless they were Heavenly Kings with emperor’s weapon or ancestors. Weaker cultivators had no place in such a conflict.</p><p>Outside of the Heavenly Cemetery, the ancestors and big shots hiding in the shadows were quiet. The battle before their very eyes had silenced them.</p><p>They saw that Monk Dazhi was continuously being pushed back by the great power’s ancestor while Xian Fan’s situation was not any better. Only Lan Yunzhu, with her Reverse-time Shuttle and Night Era Flower, was managing to suppress the Titanic Crescent Ancestor.</p><p>Eventually, a human ancestor could no longer bear it and shouted: “Are we not as great as these youths? If the youths of our human race aren’t afraid of dying, then why are we old bones afraid? Even if we die, let our deaths be meaningful!” He stepped forward and screamed: “Kill!”</p><p>With rumbling explosions, this human ancestor rushed towards the eastern altar and unleashed a fiery move capable of burning the sun and scorching the ocean.</p><p>“Ahh!” Screams appeared as several hundred ghost experts were killed by this human ancestor in an instant as their blood poured down like rain.</p><p>An ancestor was ultimately an ancestor and could immediately kill thousands with one move. Heavenly Sovereigns and Heavenly Kings were nothing before them. Perhaps a Heavenly King with an emperor’s weapon could prove to be a challenge for these ancestors.</p><p>There were a dozen ancestors guarding this place, so one of them came out to stop this human ancestor: “Human, cease your assault!”</p><p>Meanwhile, outside the cemetery, a golem ancestor also stepped out: “Today is when we deal with the ghost race! If they use our people for the sacrifice, then we shall kill all of them! Kill!” At this point, the golem ancestor rushed forward as well.</p><p>At this moment, three more ancestors emerged from outside the Heavenly Cemetery. Several hundred big shots from the other races that were hiding nearby became the vanguard.</p><p>Four ancestors led the group to attack the eastern altar. There were four altars here with many ghosts defending them. Scattering and attacking the four altars at the same time was impossible and nearly suicidal, so everyone focused their force on the eastern altar where Lan Yunzhu was.</p><p>“Stop them!” The ghost ancestor at the eastern altar gave his command, and several tens of thousands of experts ran over.</p><p>In just a moment, the two sides collided and initiated a bloody battle. The five ancestors of the other races opened the path with sovereigns and kings right behind them.</p><p>A scene of earth-shaking carnage followed right after. However, there were a lot more ghosts compared to the other races, so despite the fact that the ancestors were leading the way, the other races’ force was still surrounded by ghosts.</p><p>“Help send them off. Hurry up so we can move on with the ceremony.” The Divine Guard Captain ordered coldly.</p><p>With this command, the ancestors of the Ancestral City joined the fray. Three of them joined the battle, all with emperor’s weapons.</p><p>“Rumble!” The three Ancestral City Ancestors joined and caused the sky to be bathed in blood. Several hundred big shots from the other races were massacred, only leaving about one hundred behind.</p><p>“Ahh!” A miserable scream came from a Blood Ancestor. Despite his best effort, he couldn’t stop the killing from the three Ancestral City Ancestors and met his end as his blood spurted everywhere.</p><p>Although these were all ancestors of great powers, without an emperor’s weapon, they could be easily killed by another that did.</p><p>“Pluff! Pluff! Pluff!” At this moment, the Reverse-time Shuttle shot out rays of temporal light, causing the three alarmed Ancestral City Ancestors to block with their emperor’s weapons.</p><p>“Die!” While Lan Yunzhu was occupied with saving the ancestors from the other races, the Titanic Crescent Ancestor unleashed an invincible attack from his weapon. Even Virtuous Paragons of the same level wouldn’t be able to stop it.</p><p>However, Lan Yunzhu was well prepared and performed her Cyclical River of Fate to empower the Thousand Carp’s Reversion.</p><p>“Whoosh!” Lan Yunzhu’s time reversed, dispelling the invincible attack.</p><p>“Poof!” After dodging the attack, the Night Era Flower bloomed once more so the Titanic Crescent Ancestor could only shout as he anxiously defended himself with his true treasure.</p><p>Seeing the disadvantageous situation, Lan Yunzhu thunderously shouted: “Gather together!”</p><p>At this moment, everyone understood as Monk Dazhi uttered a cry and headed towards the ancestors of the other races. Xian Fan also ignored the Insect King Ancestor and ran towards the others.</p><p>Within a short period of time, Lan Yunzhu’s group came together and the ancestors of the great powers erected a powerful barrier. However, this barrier wouldn’t be able to last long. The Titanic Crescent Ancestor and Insect King Ancestor, with their true weapons, rushed forward. Given sufficient time, they could easily destroy this defensive perimeter. Moreover, there were also several hundred thousand ghosts lying in wait. With a command from the captain, several dozen ancestors would attack all at once.</p><p>This powerful barrier from the other races’ ancestors might be powerful, but it was merely a small boat amidst a raging sea. They were against the unbeatable might of the ghost race!</p><p>The ghost experts were not in a rush to destroy this defense since, in their eyes, Lan Yunzhu’s group was akin to a beast trapped in a cage with no escape.</p><p>“Hahahaha! You ignored the accepting heavens and barged into the unwelcoming hell! Even a Golden Immortal from the Great Firmament wouldn’t be able to save you!” [1. I would say this is a bit wacky to use in a xianxia novel with its own established cultivation, but a Great Firmament Golden Immortal is a high ranking immortal in eastern mythology, such as Journey to the West or Investiture of the Gods.]</p><p>The great characters from the other races were completely pale. Dozens of ancestors surrounded them along with hundreds of thousands of other experts. No matter how strong they may be, it was impossible to break out from such a powerful force.</p><p>Lan Yunzhu was still quite calm and asked Xian Fan who was squatting down next to her: “Does your sect have no one else here?”</p><p>“No, what about the Thousand Carp River?” Xian Fan was using spirit medicines to recover their blood energy. The battle from earlier wasted a lot.</p><p>Xian Fan’s body was encompassed in the elemental armor so one couldn’t see Xian Fan’s expression, but from the panting, it was clear that Xian Fan didn’t have much strength left. The Mortal Sword was powerful, but it required too much energy unlike Lan Yunzhu’s treasures.</p><p>“They all left already.” Lan Yunzhu replied with a shake of her head. She only stayed behind to wait for Li Qiye.</p><p>“Amitabha, amitabha.” Monk Dazhi was also sitting down since he needed time to recover as well. Once he recovered a bit, he spoke: “It seems like this is going to be our end.”</p><p>“What’s the big deal?” Xian Fan was still quite domineering and proclaimed with a surging battle intent: “Wait until my energy recovers. I’ll kill all of them till they wail like ghosts and cry like wolves!”</p><p>Lan Yunzhu could only force a smile. Although Xian Fan spoke domineeringly, the present situation was all too clear. They had heaven-defying means, but on the other side were the ancestors from imperial lineages, so they couldn’t reverse the situation. They also had emperor’s true treasures no weaker than theirs.</p><p>“How about the two of you break out while we guard the back. We will pave a path of escape for you both to go report to the Thousand Carp River and Immortal Kingdom!” A golem ancestor gravely suggested.</p><p>Everyone running away was an impossibility, so only Lan Yunzhu and Xian Fan would be given the chance to escape.</p><p>Lan Yuzhu shook her head in response: “It is too late even if we break out. The ceremony would already be over by the time the people from the Distant Cloud get here.”</p><p>“Are we actually this powerless?” A great character asked in despair. They wanted to save the mortals in the altars, but now, they themselves were trapped and would be killed here.</p><p>A human Heavenly King spoke sharply: “No matter what, we have to give it a shot. We will leave our fate to the heavens. If we just sit and watch the ghost race sacrifice our people, then in the future, the ghost race will think that the other races are easily bullied. Even if we die, we have to drag along a few ghost kings. The more we kill the better!” The moment they came out, they already knew that they would all die. They only had several hundred people so despite having four ancestors on their side, their opponent consisted of dozens of ancestors and countless more experts.</p><p>Despite knowing that there was no hope, they were unable to bear just sitting around and watching the ceremony sacrifice millions of mortals. Even youths like Lan Yunzhu didn’t mind fighting, so how could those of the previous generation like them sit still?</p><p>A great character from the Blood Race spoke with hatred: “That’s right, pay blood with blood! Even if I die, I shall use my blood sacrifice to blow away those goddamn ghosts!”</p><p>“Do we really have no other choice?” A Heavenly Devil Ancestor asked one last time.</p><p>“Maybe?” Lan Yunzhu would not give up until the very end. She had the best chance to escape safely among the group since she could completely suppress the Titanic Crescent Ancestor. However, she wouldn’t give up just yet!</p><p>Xian Fan was still recovering energy as they proudly spoke: “Don’t worry, once my blood energy is back, I will throw out several forbidden techniques to kill them. Hmph! What is so great about the ghost race? Sooner or later, I will make it so that there will be no peace left for the ghosts!” [2. Xian Fan really likes these phrases. This second phrase doesn’t go as well in English as the first one, so I modified it. The raw is — kill them until their chickens fly and dogs bark. This should evoke a chaotic image where one’s home/livestock is no longer safe from the conflict.]</p><p>A human ancestor could only sigh after seeing Xian Fan’s pride: “All of you, leave. We old geezers will watch your backs. Although we can’t save the mortals, you all have tried your best. There is no fear of running out of firewood as long as the verdant hills are still there. As long as our human race still have geniuses like you, there will be hope of taking away the peace of the ghosts in the future.”</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>[spoiler title='588 Teaser'][caption id="" align="alignnone" width="640"]<img width="640" alt="" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/8/005/094/17e/0d91eb8.jpg" height="432"> Will the other races only watch the three young ones fight?[/caption][/spoiler]</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
