He leisurely strolled in as if this was his own garden.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Zhentian, the Prince of Darkness, the Terra King, and the Conch Overlord also looked at him from their pavilions with glints in their eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were all influential big shots with illustrious fame. Despite their past grievances with him, they still remained calm under this situation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye looked around and said: “So many came I see. It would be good if everyone is here, I can take this rare opportunity to deal with all the past grievances. There’s no need to run back and forth.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His arrogant tone left everyone breathless. Many couldn’t help but praise him in their minds.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An expert slowly praised: “This brat is arrogant and overbearing to a crazy level.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew about the feud between Zhentian and Li Qiye. With all of his enemies here, he was still completely unperturbed and was even provoking them. Anyone would have to admire him in this situation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist, the human clan’s section is over here.” A sea demon was leading Li Qiye towards the human’s seating area.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a desolate corner at the back of the venue like a vacant place meant for a squatting beggar.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humans have been weak at Heaven Spirit for a long time and had no status worth mentioning. It was easy to see that they would be arranged to sit in this tiny corner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t bother giving it a glance before dismissively speaking: “Who says that I want to sit there?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Human cultivators sit over there.” The sea demon guide put on a stern face. Many sea demons didn’t like him and viewed him as an enemy. If they weren’t afraid of Li Qiye’s power, they would have attacked him already.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their eyes, humans were only a minor race akin to little insects. Since when were they allowed to be so presumptuous? Alas, Li Qiye was too heaven-defying, there was nothing they could do.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will sit over there.” Li Qiye glanced at the top and smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s reserved for the three supreme races.” The sea demon turned a bit cold at this moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this about supreme? They’re only a bunch of weaklings.” Li Qiye smiled and went forward.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, please show some respect.” An old man blocked his way. There were divine diagrams on his body with dozens of experts accompanying him. It was clear that none of them were weak due to their powerful blood energies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s a minister.” Someone whispered: “I heard there are eight old ministers in total presiding over this convention.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at him and flatly said: “Back down, good dogs don’t block the way.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s expression immediately changed. He had worked under a sea god before and had an illustrious prestige that was respected by all. But now, Li Qiye showed disdain right away, how could he not become angry?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old minister raised his voice: “You should sit where you belong, don’t trouble yourself.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and leisurely said: “I’ll be sitting up there at the foremost position.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old minister coldly said: “The pavilions are meant for the three supreme races, please go back.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who says that I want to sit at those pavilions? A bunch of nobodies wants to sit on the same level as me? Go, place an imperial throne in front of those three royal thrones and I shall sit there.” Such words left everyone gasping for breath. Everyone knew just how domineering he was. If he really wanted to sit in a pavilion, this old minister wouldn’t have been able to do anything to him outside of just creating some minor annoyances.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, Li Qiye actually wanted to sit above the three thrones that symbolize the greatest existences. Remember, they represented an Immortal Emperor, a sea god, and a treefather of Heaven Spirit. Even Zhentian and the prince’s group wouldn’t dare to talk about sitting in front of these royal thrones.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Li Qiye demanded to be seated in front of them. This demand was too overbearing and out of line.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sea demon couldn’t help but yell: “You have no respect for anyone, you actually dare to blaspheme the great beings!?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The minister’s expression turned unsightly as well. As someone who had worked under a sea god before, he couldn’t tolerate Li Qiye’s attitude towards a sea god.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye lazily glanced at the minister and casually said: “If you don’t want to, then go to the side, I’ll let someone else prepare a seat.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where did this ignorant fool come from? Minister, let people take him out.” The Conch Overlord finally spoke. Even his feeble words were full of unquestionable divinity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone turned silent and held their breaths after hearing the overlord. The atmosphere became quite tense since a battle might break out at any moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The minister coldly spoke: “Sir, will you leave, or do we have to escort you...”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts behind him were quite eager, evident by the cold glints in their eyes. Once the command came out, they wouldn’t hesitate to cull Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Before the minister could even finish, the experts behind him were sent flying at the same time. They all spewed out blood, creating a spectacular scene that resembled a blooming blood lotus.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Li Qiye still stood there as if he didn’t move from start to finish.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He nonchalantly stated: “Do you know why I spared your life? It is because I need a slave to wipe the floor. After all, these bloodstains would make people feel uncomfortable.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such a big tone!” The other seven ministers stood out and immediately surrounded Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just a bunch of errand boys and lowly vassals, you’re not even soldiers.” Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at them: “Go, do your job and find me an imperial throne then place it above these three seats, then I shall spare you all.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Naive fool!” The ministers were furious. How could they endure this humiliation? One of them grimly said: “Human ant, you aren’t even qualified to sit at the pavilion, yet you dare to boast about sitting on the throne above?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they knew just how powerful he was, the most powerful beings such, as the Conch Overlord, were here at the convention, so they weren’t afraid of Li Qiye. Moreover, they had found him unpleasant to the eye for a long time now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who says he isn’t qualified?” A voice came about.

The whole venue lit up because of her presence. All eyes darted towards her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman was tall and slender.
