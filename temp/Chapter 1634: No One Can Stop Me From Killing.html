<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What can one arrow do?” Li Qiye spoke during the prince’s bewilderment. In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye was already standing in front of him as if he had been there the entire time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince turned pale. A Heavenly God like him didn’t notice Li Qiye’s shift of position at all. This was quite frightening to him since an enemy like this could easily take his life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The startled prince instantly retreated in order to maintain a safe distance with Li Qiye. However, with a strange noise, the space he was retreating to suddenly turned into a quagmire, trapping him within. This made him countless times slower; each action was at a snail’s pace.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.” As he was struggling within, the space transformed into a prison and rendered him immobile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are too careless. Even if you are at the Heavenly God level, you still can’t do anything before me, no different from an insect.” Li Qiye said with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The stars in the sky were crushed as Long Aotian broke away from the dragon and bull. He rushed forward and shouted: “Brother, I got you!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He instantly appeared in front of Li Qiye and unleashed a blow capable of annihilating the world and the deities with the intent of pushing his foe back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His speed was truly something else since he only needed one step to make it back from the sky in order to save the prince. His abilities were virtually unmatched in this generation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Li Qiye pointed forward and banished Long Aotian into a different spatial sphere. The guy instantly disappeared and was trapped by this technique.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No one can stop me from killing.” Li Qiye chuckled and directly unleashed a finger strike at the prince’s forehead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” The prince howled before death, a cry full of unwillingness and regrets but it was too late.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood oozed out from his head while his eyes were still wide opened. Death came before he could accomplish anything in his life. How could his path have ended here?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” Long Aotian broke his way back from the banishment. The short amount of time it took was indicative of his terrible strength and speed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye!” Long Aotian could no longer remain calm after seeing the prince’s death. His eyes turned cold, full of murderous intention.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Aotian.” Li Qiye leisurely stared at him as if he was staring at a dog.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His demeanor made everyone take a deep breath without anything to say. How could Fiercest treat the imperial prince of the Soaring Immortal Sect like this? His domineering nature was truly peerless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Aotian directly released all of his blood energy, causing rumbling blasts. In a short time, his energy engulfed the world and all of the Grand Sea.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It became a terrible storm capable of devouring everything in this world. It was ruthless, merciless, and brutal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People quivered before this terrible storm of blood energy. Their breath was taken away from them, forcing them to lower their body. The crowd became pale after seeing his fury and finally understood that this was his real power. He didn’t reveal this strength when fighting against the dragon and Yuanhou earlier.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The Grand Sea seemingly exploded. Divine rings floated around Aotian with clear imperial runes on them. When these rings were rotating, it looked as if multiple emperors were personally coming down.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their imperial prestige forced weaker cultivators to drop to the ground. They had no chance of opposing this type of aura.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank.” A sword hymn resounded as Aotian wielded his weapon of choice. It radiated with boundless light and illuminated the world. Even Godkings felt these rays of light prickling them with pain.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this sword in his hand, the world was his for the taking. He had an unstoppable aura at this moment. Not to mention the weaker crowd, even Virtuous Paragons would run away from the battlefield. God-Monarchs became serious and watched from a safe distance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Virtuous Sword, Immortal Emperor Ren Xian’s true fate weapon. Its imposing emergence allowed Aotian to turn into an Immortal Emperor, ready to rage against the rest of the world!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Virtuous Sword.” Li Qiye didn’t mind at all to see the weapon. With a clank, a saber as white as snow appeared in his hand. Others had a hard time staring directly at it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Benevolent Saber!” An old Godking nearby shouted after seeing it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed that the saber was coming back to life after being in his embrace with an exuberant amount of life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Virtuous Sword versus the Benevolent Saber!” Many glanced at each other after seeing the chosen weapons of the two combatants. Even the weathered Godkings here became startled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A contest between the saber and the sword! These were two popular weapons. The sword was considered the king of weapons while the saber acted as the tyrant. They served two very prominent roles on the dao path.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More importantly, their masters were also full of characters. Immortal Emperor Min Ren was the bringer of the Emperors Era and well-known for his benevolent nature. Meanwhile, Immortal Emperor Ren Xian was considered a wise sage of humanity</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two emperors and two weapons from two distant generations; their duel has finally begun!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no sound in the vicinity outside of heartbeats. Long Aotian stared intensely at the saber in Li Qiye’s grasp. As the master of the Virtuous Sword, he naturally knew the significance of the saber coming back to life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Aotian released more floating weapons above his head. Their terrible imperial auras assaulted the world. All existences shuddered and prostrated before them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His arsenal included Immortal Emperor Life Treasures, ancient immortal artifacts, and timeworn weapons of the gods… Each of them was capable of sweeping through this world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People were in awe to see so many magnificent weapons. Long Aotian incited endless envy by taking them out so easily.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ordinary imperial lineage wouldn’t have so many superb weapons but Aotian alone had more than enough. This was enough to drive people crazy. A sect with five emperors truly lived up to its fame.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s quite a few weapons.” Li Qiye leisurely looked at Aotian and said: “But it’s useless. Forget it, I won’t bully you by attacking first. That would rob you of the chance to even retaliate.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, don’t worry. You won’t be able to stop my Heavenly Annihilation!” Aotian claimed with a chilling tone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time he was treated with such disdain after making his debut. Ever since he came to Mortal Emperor, he was unstoppable even by himself. This was the reason why people called him the Denary King.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both peerless geniuses and old Godkings viewed him as a dangerous enemy but now, Li Qiye didn’t put him in his eyes at all. How could he not be frustrated with this development?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Aotian’s statement did scare many people here. A Heavenly Annihilation carried wondrous power, especially when its user was someone as young and vigorous as Aotian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, they didn’t find his ability to use an annihilation too surprising. After all, this was the heaven’s favorite child with the arts of five emperors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only a Heavenly Annihilation.” Li Qiye nonchalantly retorted: “When my Soul Annihilation comes out, your attack will be kneeling instantly.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Aotian’s expression turned unsightly and couldn’t maintain his normal composure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Soul Annihilation? What’s that?” A junior has never even heard of this name. A few experts here weren’t aware either.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s using an annihilation with a true treasure that’s even stronger than a Heavenly Annihilation.” A Godking that had followed an Immortal Emperor in the past explained to his juniors: “This attack requires the Heaven’s Will Secret Law of the emperor on top of gaining the acceptance of the weapon as well. Moreover, the user needs enough vitality and strength to handle the awakening of the soul within the weapon. That’s the necessary conditions to use this legendary attack!”</span></p>
