<p><b>Chapter 464: Crossing The Sea</b></p><p>“If you asked about the creation on the other side, then you must know about other things as well. Nightsea and this black sea before us cannot be crossed without a ferry. If I guessed correctly, then you have brought along the treasure boat left behind by your patriarch!” Li Qiye slowly finished.</p><p>These light words scared the soul out of Monk Dazhi. His patriarch indeed left behind a treasure boat. It was not an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure or anything so it had been locked away in the swamp’s treasury. Very few disciples had seen this boat, yet an outsider like Li Qiye was revealing its details. This gave the monk quite a fright.</p><p>“This…” The monk awkwardly rubbed his hands together while not knowing what to do.</p><p>Li Qiye interrupted him and dismissively said: “It’s fine, don’t be tense. I don’t intend to borrow your boat. Such a trivial issue cannot deter me. If I wanted to cross, it would be as easy as flipping my palm.</p><p>“I know you have some items on you, but heed my warning. Do not dream about this creation or else your swamp will be destroyed within half a year. Although your sect is indeed powerful, there are a few things that should never be provoked. Don’t turn your patriarch’s efforts into nothingness; don’t let an emperor’s lineage become buried at your hands!”</p><p>“Is it really that terrible?” The monk asked.</p><p>Li Qiye coldly glared at him and answered: “Hahaha, Monk, forget about you, even if your patriarch was alive, he would be quite apprehensive about this. Some things are far beyond your imagination!”</p><p>The monk quivered after recalling the patriarch’s warning. What could possibly be so terrifying that even his patriarch had to leave behind a special warning?</p><p>“Haha, don’t worry, Benefactor Li. I know when to advance and when to retreat. Propriety is also not a foreign concept.” The monk continued with a smile: “If there is nothing else, then I shall take my leave first.”</p><p>Li Qiye glanced at him and asked: “Not coming with us?”</p><p>“Umm… I’m… busy, I’ll be going now—” The monk dryly laughed and replied.</p><p>“Hiding from your old lady?” Li Qiye burst out in laughter and asked after seeing the monk’s awkward state.</p><p>With reddened cheeks, the monk replied with an awkward smile: “Hehe, I have to go change my outfit. My life will be over if I’m caught, over…”</p><p>“You don’t like your old lady?” Li Qiye looked at the monk and asked.</p><p>“No, never, this is absolutely not the case!” The monk jumped up and uttered. Under Li Qiye’s teasing scrutiny, he reluctantly confessed: “It really isn’t like that. Martial Sister and I are childhood sweethearts, and our relationship is very good. However, some time ago, the elders of the sect wanted me to accept the responsibility… They want us to get married so that Big Sister can help me manage the sect.”</p><p>“Oh, I see.” Li Qiye nodded and teased: “Anxiety before the wedding. However, a man who runs away from battle is too girly, are you still a man?”</p><p>Monk Dazhi was very embarrassed. He then gave a mirthless smile and said: “Benefactor Li, I’ll be going now.” With that, his body shifted and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“The Nether Crossing Swamp...” Li Qiye smiled and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>Li Qiye had a good impression of the Nether Crossing Swamp. Even though, during that era, Li Qiye kept his word and didn’t train or give any advice to Immortal Emperor Ming Du, the emperor still respected Li Qiye as a teacher. This was because the emperor knew that he was only able to leave Necropolis and obtain a great creation due to the hard work of the Dark Crow.</p><p>This creation created a firm foundation for the emperor after he left the city, allowing him to reach the apex and the Heaven’s Will.</p><p>Before anyone noticed, Li Qiye and Qiurong Wanxue were standing at the edge of the golden ocean not too far from the Yang Nightfish. The splashes from the thousands of fish could reach their bodies.</p><p>Their movement caught the attention of many people.</p><p>“What are they trying to do?” The majority of the cultivators stood far away since no one wanted to get close to such a battlefield for it was suicidal. Once the gigantic shadow and the Fish King fought, even the strongest cultivators would be annihilated by the residual energy.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that they want to cross?” A person speculated.</p><p>“That is suicidal!” The Divine Spark Prince sneered while staring at the two in the far distance.</p><p>The other young geniuses, such as Golden Child and Ghost Monk, were also spectating. Many people wanted to cross the black sea up ahead, but all of their attempts were unsuccessful.</p><p>“Fei Cangqiong, the descendant of the Nether-soaring Ghost Race, was said to have the fastest speed. He once claimed that he could fly to all the corners of the world. Earlier, he tried to fly over the ocean, but what was the result? He only drowned in the black sea!” A person coldly said: “An ordinary human ant still dreams about flying over? Truly wishful thinking.”</p><p>Previous attempts included flying and utilizing treasures to quickly rush over, but all had failed. Once one stepped into the black sea’s territory, they and all their treasures would fall and drown.</p><p>After several ghost geniuses failed, no one dared to force their way across. Instead, they looked for other methods.</p><p>Li Qiye looked at the gigantic shadow in the distance and focused his gaze on the thousands of handlers behind it.</p><p>Seeing Li Qiye’s expression, Qiurong Wanxue guessed what he wanted to do and anxiously asked: “Can we cross it?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, it is a piece of cake.” Li Qiye smiled and said after picking a target: “Hug me tightly, we’re about to go.”</p><p>Qiurong Wanxue listened and tightly hugged Li Qiye’s waist while blushing.</p><p>Li Qiye pulled her in even closer after taking a deep breath. Now, she was standing in front of him as he clasped her waist. The two of them were tightly pressed against each other face-to-face.</p><p>Being in such an intimate pose while hugging her Young Noble’s chest caused Qiurong Wanxue to become quite hot.</p><p>However, Li Qiye was not in the mood to enjoy this romantic situation. He roared as his blood energy began to surge to perform the Thousand Hands Against The Nine Worlds. Myriad hands appeared behind his back as if they were lifting up three thousand worlds.</p><p>One pair of hands lifted the Nine Words True Bow. A divine arrow made from universal laws was placed on the gently drawn-back bowstring.</p><p>This mantra arrow was the last word, “Forward”, from the nine True Words. This word turned into a universal law to become an unparalleled divine arrow. [1. Reminder — Daoist’s nine words or nine syllables. I modified the translation a bit so that the English version will have nine words as well. When You are climbing up a mountain or delving deep into a forest or going into the wild, constantly recite these nine words in Your heart or speak softly and everything will go smoothly. It means no spirits, ghosts, demons, wild animals, and poisonous insects will harm You and You are protected from all dangers. There are also nine hand seals that go along with the nine words.]</p><p>“They actually want to cross!” A bunch of youths were in an uproar.</p><p>“Can they do it?!” Many people secretly wished that Li Qiye would be successful. They began to lose hope after seeing so many failures, but if Li Qiye could do it, then it would prove that this mission was not impossible.</p><p>However, there were also those who hoped that Li Qiye would fail, such as the Divine Spark Prince: “Hmph! What an ignorant fool, just wait for your death without a burial!”</p><p>“Poof!” Li Qiye shot out the word “Forward”; this divine mantra arrow pierced through the wind and time itself.</p><p>The moment this arrow was released, Li Qiye and Qiurong Wanxue both disappeared from this world as if they had evaporated.</p><p>This arrow seemed to have crossed to the past from one spacetime to another and then disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Where did they go?” The spectating cultivators looked around to find Li Qiye and Qiurong Wanxue.</p><p>Everything happened so fast. In just a split second, this arrow shot through the head of a handler. He didn’t even have the chance to react before falling into the black sea.</p><p>What was even more incredible was that Li Qiye and Qiurong Wanxue then appeared on the ferry in the same posture as when they disappeared — still tightly hugging each other.</p><p>“Impossible!” Some jumped up in complete disbelief.</p><p>Li Qiye was not the only one who thought about stealing a ferry. Some had thought about it, but they couldn’t carry it out. Even powerful treasures could not kill a ferry handler since they would become powerless once they entered the black sea’s territory.</p><p>Of course, Li Qiye’s Nine Words True Bow was not something their treasures could compare to. Once the “Forward” arrow was shot out, it would allow him to instantaneously travel anywhere, completely disregarding the heaven-defying seals or defensive perimeter of any location.</p><p>After determining his target, he shot the word “Forward”. This arrow instantly pierced the handler’s head, allowing it to bring the two of them to the boat.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t lock onto the other shore. Otherwise, he could shoot out this “Forward” arrow to take them there directly.</p><p>Li Qiye’s successful attempt at seizing a ferry shocked everyone. The impossible had happened!</p><p>The Divine Spark Prince was both shocked and angry, thus he spoke with a sneer: “Becoming enemies with the handlers... So foolish!”</p><p>Everyone knew that attacking a handler would bring about a personal disaster. Antagonizing the handlers and sentiments inside Necropolis would result in a bad end.</p><p>After Li Qiye took over the boat, the gigantic shadow suddenly exuded a terrifying breath as thousands of handlers immediately surrounded him.</p><p>“It’s over, this guy will be eaten alive by all those handlers!” Someone exclaimed out loud.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>[spoiler title='464 Teaser']“If you asked about the creation on the other side, then you must know about other things as well.
