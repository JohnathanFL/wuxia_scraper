This was an extremely precious true treasure, yet it was still split in half by the Benevolent Saber!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was silent for a while. Without an Immortal Emperor True Treasure, he shouldn’t even think about fighting against Li Qiye even if he was an Apex Godking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many took in deep breaths after seeing this. Some even turned white. In the past, not many had the pleasure of seeing Li Qiye in action, but now, they finally understood just how strong he was. Three slashes was enough to take down an Apex Godking. The white general would have died if Zhentian didn’t help him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Li Qiye had the advantage of using an imperial true treasure, one couldn’t deny his own strength and qualification to compete against Zhentian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white general quietly retreated to the side. It was now his master’s turn to fight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” More ice chains began to lock onto Li Qiye, wishing to freeze him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, the fox’s tail has been exposed.” Li Qiye laughed at Zhentian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite both being in the valley, Li Qiye was affected while the master and disciple duo were completely fine. Even the blind would know what was going on.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a dark expression, Zhentian replied: “You and I have nothing else to say.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true.” Li Qiye cheerfully said: “Unfortunately, the prince’s group won’t show their faces so this little formation is useless. We’ll fight after I break it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The Benevolent Saber slashed down, causing the world to turn bright. It split the entire valley right down the middle to reveal the ice formation hidden beneath. Of course, this formation wasn’t spared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smilingly declared: “Now there’s nothing left to hold us back. It’s time for us to have a simple fight. Your bones shall pave the way for my ascension.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian calmly retorted: “Having too much confidence is called arrogance!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am arrogant indeed.” Li Qiye continued to grin: “Watch, I’ll become even more arrogant by not using the Benevolent Saber to defeat you. Otherwise, once you lose, you’ll be unconvinced and think that I need an Immortal Emperor True Treasure to defeat you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian’s eyes narrowed after hearing this. Like he said earlier, this was too much complacency. However, he didn’t know the reason why Li Qiye was so confident. He was startled to see his opponent put the saber away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd held their breaths after seeing the two facing each other. Everyone understood that this was the prelude to the war for the throne. After this battle ends, Heaven Spirit will have its candidate!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of the result, the winner will become the representative of Heaven Spirit!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, some people wished for Zhentian’s victory. After all, he was a charming spirit; it would be the race’s honor for him to be its representative.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, others wanted Li Qiye to win. It would simply be a miracle. To be able to kill an Era Evader? Just how proud and ferocious would this feat be?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere turned tense right away for the people outside of the valley with their hearts hanging by a thread. Of course, there was no lack of excitement. Not even in their dreams did they think that one day, they would be able to watch a fight for the throne in person!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I haven’t personally fought for a long time now.” Zhentian’s eyes turned cold while revealing a blinding radiance. There were suns and moons floating inside his pupils. His entire being suddenly turned gigantic.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it, I’ll refrain from making a joke out of you before the battle by exposing your past. It would be a bit too despicable to make your dao heart waver beforehand.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having heard that, Zhentian’s eyes emitted an endless bloodthirst. Even the world felt the chill from this murderous intent, let alone everyone else.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who didn’t attend the convention of myriad races didn’t know what Li Qiye was referring to. However, those who were privy glanced at each other. They wanted to know whether this was the truth or not.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There had always been a popular belief in Heaven Spirit, that Zhentian went into seclusion out of love for his brother, Immortal Emperor Ta Kong. Because of this, the emperor still called him big brother after becoming emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along, many experts in Heaven Spirit believed this story. Many charming spirits viewed Zhentian as their pride. After all, the position of emperor was too tempting for anyone. Just how grand and respectable was it to give up this position for his brother? This was a wonderful sentiment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, during the convention, Li Qiye uncovered Zhentian’s old tales. He didn’t evade the era because of brotherhood. He did so because his legion was named Heaven Suppression and the Black Dragon King scolded him for this. This was the reason why he didn’t dare to compete for the Heaven’s Will.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some did believe this particular tale. After all, who would be willing to give up the throne? Alas, many charming spirit cultivators still thought that Li Qiye was simply defaming him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the main question looming in everyone’s mind was about the truth of the past. Did Zhentian give up on the throne out of brotherly love, or was it out of fear towards the Black Dragon King?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, it’s time to fight.” Li Qiye stepped towards the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian didn’t hesitate and soared up as well to confront Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” Li Qiye casually swung his arm and a gigantic battle stage descended from the sky. This battle stage was initially hovering in the air, but it was pulled down by Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was ancient and mottled with divine runes all over it. These runes were quite powerful and seemed to have been refined by some wise sages of the olden days to form this battle stage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were cracks and holes everywhere. When a stage of this magnitude received this type of damage, it meant that the fights that took place here were incredible.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come.” Li Qiye slowly spoke to Zhentian while standing on the stage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian stepped inside, ready to fight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivators nearby immediately flew up as well in order to watch this earth-shattering duel.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that if a duel of this level was done outside of a battle stage, the world itself might shatter from the black holes and scars left behind by their attacks.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian stared at Li Qiye and uttered: “If you lose, you must quit immediately.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quite confident.” Li Qiye leisurely glanced at him and replied: “Will it be you alone, or will the prince and the others join in?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This prompted many cultivators to glance at each other. Some even opened their heavenly gazes to sweep over the area. However, no one found the prince’s group.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, you are too presumptuous!” Zhentian uttered: “Are you so certain of victory already?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and replied: “I don’t want to make you feel bad so early, but my victory is assured. Since you want to fight, we can raise the stakes. I’m not a nice person anyway, so let’s make this a fight to the death. If you lose, you will leave behind your life. I wouldn’t mind watching you cut off your own head either.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian glared at him. He wasn’t a nice person either, so he retorted: “Very well. If you lose, you will have to cut off your head as well. I also want to see it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very well.” Li Qiye agreed right away: “However, you won’t have the chance since your death has been guaranteed after opposing me.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.” Zhentian scowled. Even though he didn’t become angry, his demeanor already showed his annoyance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” He released his vitality. In the blink of an eye, it engulfed the world as if he wanted to flood it. With this invasion of power, everything else seemed incredibly insignificant. His blood energy was an endless sea. The world itself was only a tiny boat that could capsize when a storm comes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the other experts here also felt trivial. It was as if Zhentian’s rage could annihilate everyone while his wrath could slaughter billions.</span></p>
