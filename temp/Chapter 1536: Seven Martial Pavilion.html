I didn’t know that you have personally arrived in Heaven Spirit. Trying to make a deal with you was a momentary lapse of propriety. Please forgive this ignorant one. I don’t dare to trouble you with this life replenishment matter.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he didn’t know about Li Qiye’s identity before, he tried to negotiate with the guy. But now, with this knowledge in mind, who would dare to negotiate with the eternal dark hand? Even emperors would have to take the long way around, others weren’t qualified to do so. He was no exception either.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve always been a man of my words.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve again: “If I have agreed to replenish your life, I shall do so.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, I won’t ever forget your grace.” The frightened ancestor finally heaved a sigh of relief and bowed again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll lead the way for you.” He said with reverence after standing up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye nodded: “Very well, I haven’t visited your pavilion in a while, it’s a good time to see its pretty sceneries.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hallowed Ancestor quickly told the Seven Martial Goddess standing next to him: “Pavilion Lord, Miss Su isn’t familiar with our home so why don’t you show her around?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he lacked a clear understanding of Li Qiye, he has heard of some legends before. Because of this, he didn’t wish for a third party during their conversation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The goddess took Su Yonghuang away to fulfill her role as a good host.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, please come in.” The ancestor became Li Qiye’s guide.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He entered the pavilion and took his time appreciating the beautiful sceneries with the ancestor. It was quite vast and magnificent all around with ethereal mists and clouds. The mountains and rivers were flourishing just like a land of immortals. Anyone would forget their way home from loving it so much. There was no rush to meet the Prime Sea God at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, the entire sect was very quiet with virtually no ordinary disciples around. Even the experts were nowhere to be found, only the ancestors showed themselves.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because the Hallowed Ancestor ordered specifically for the disciples to cultivate in isolation since Li Qiye was coming. He was afraid that some disciples might not know the immensity of the heaven and earth. If they were to annoy Li Qiye, then the pavilion would face a great disaster. Even the Ancestral Terra was annihilated and their sect wasn’t that much stronger than the terra. An angry Li Qiye might mean an unavoidable doom.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he has heard that the eternal dark hand didn’t like others talking about him, especially about his past. Because of this, he was afraid of the disciples being too curious and think about a few things. That would lead to more trouble.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire pavilion was open for him including the forbidden and secret locations. The ancestor understood that if Li Qiye wanted to go somewhere, no one would be able to stop him anyway. Since he could come and go as he please, it would look better for them to open the entire sect to him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hallowed took him to many places unavailable to the protectors and elders as his guide without holding back. Eventually, the two of them reached the highest peak overlooking all of the magnificent sceneries of the sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye took in the scene and eventually said: “The Seven Martial Pavilion is a treasure ground. Prime was very insightful indeed and has expended painstaking effort to create the sect here.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our descendants are blessed today due to the protection of the progenitor and the wise sages.” Hallowed hurriedly answered: “Everything here was left behind for us already. Alas, we of the future generations are incompetent and can’t make it even stronger.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at him and said: “Don’t worry, I don’t have any desire towards your pavilion but I do know that your sect has accumulated more than enough power with no lack of treasuries and resources.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being revealed by Li Qiye left Hallowed with a red complexion. He smiled wryly in response: “It’s all due to our progenitor, including the current shielding situation. We are simply reaping the benefits of having a golden spoon.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“While it’s true that he has performed the overarching shielding plan for the sect, the current accumulation and power of the sect aren’t all due to him. This takes many generations and part of it is because of your contribution.” Li Qiye said flatly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This lowly one didn’t do much at all, can’t reach the apex and can’t get into your sight, Your Excellency.” Hallowed humbly responded with haste.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need to be humble. The hidden resources are quite incredible at this moment but I don’t care for this particular inheritance, don’t worry.” Li Qiye reiterated nonchalantly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, just a bit of resource, not enough to impress you at all, Your Excellency.” Hallowed smiled hollowly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite being very famous in Heaven Spirit, the pavilion maintained a low-key presence. This wasn’t to say that they didn’t bother with worldly affairs or chose a reclusive way of life. It was because they rarely took in guests.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any other powerful sea god’s lineage would be quite eventful and crowded. There would be great fanfare after the birth of a sea god since they would accept the tributes from sea demons everywhere.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, the pavilion didn’t do so. Only extremely important people could visit this sect as a guest. They also rarely took in tributes or meeting requests from other sea demons. Most people in Heaven Spirit, especially the sea demons, found this quite peculiar.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ordinary people couldn’t see it but not Li Qiye. The pavilion’s ancestral ground was completely hidden by an extremely heaven-defying method.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the surface, the pavilion wasn’t different from the other sea god’s lineages. However, it was hiding many things that couldn’t be seen from the outside. One had to enter before discovering these hidden matters. Of course, only someone of Li Qiye’s level would be able to see through the true mysteries once inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such concealment had no effect on Li Qiye even if Hallowed tried to.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s a reason why your progenitor has the title, Prime.” Li Qiye uttered slowly: “Even though he started later compared to the Roaring Conch’s progenitor, his outstanding vision wasn’t something the Roaring Conch’s progenitor could compare to. Even before becoming a sea god, he already had plans. Despite failing to make a choice like the others, he still left behind a backup plan for your pavilion or even the entire sea demon race.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued: “But as for that Roaring Conch Sea God? His choice might have added some advantages but it came from a self-serving intent.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well…” Hallowed became frightened and whispered: “Your Excellency, is this the right place to discuss this?” With that, he secretly pointed up above.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled in response: “Don’t worry, spying is possible in the past but now, I actually want to see it happen. If they dare to come out, I shall fight but if they continue hiding, there’s nothing I can do even if I want to initiate a war.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hallowed was scared out of his mind after hearing this secretive topic. He couldn’t help but steal glances at the sky and was a bit afraid of a pair of eyes suddenly opening above.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, his sect has been hiding many things. In fact, this has been the case for three generations of sea gods.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, he understood that the eternal dark hand had no fear of anything. If someone actually dared to meet the challenge, a war will ensue to the bitter end.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hallowed wouldn’t dare to conjecture on the final victor but Li Qiye as the dark hand had absolute confidence. Of course, this would mean that the disaster would come early.</span></p>
