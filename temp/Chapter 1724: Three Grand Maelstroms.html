He said flatly: “The path towards Immortal Emperor has always been merciless, paved with skeletons. An emperor requires their adversaries’ bones to pave the way. I was merciful yet why must all of you force me to ascend this way?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the dull tone from him, it still silenced the experts in the nine worlds. Everyone was aware of the cruel competition towards the throne. However, without having a personal experience, people didn’t hold it in mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when they saw Li Qiye destroying one hundred thousand men with just one fist, a realization of its cruel nature began. The popular description was not empty words but reality.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, some people shuddered in fear. They swore to never let their descendants walk on the imperial path. One emperor, countless bones.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one would blame him for being merciless. If he didn’t kill them, they would still try to kill him. It was that simple and brutal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Li Qiye wanted to leave some talents and sparks to the nine worlds, the alliance kept on challenging him. Thus, he had no reason to be merciful. It was not in his nature to do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye then stared at the Unidao True God and his junior at his side and said emotionlessly: “Go back. I shall let you go out of consideration for your father.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The god was pale despite possessing an amazing bloodline and power. He quivered and couldn’t restrain the fear inside his heart. He felt so insignificant before the Prime Emperor. Just one finger alone could pulverize him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His disciple couldn’t stand straight at all. He has considered himself a genius all this time but he didn’t have the courage to look at the emperor. If it wasn’t for the true god supporting him, he would be paralyzed on the ground right now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for showing mercy, Your Highness.” The frightened true god prostrated towards Li Qiye before taking his disciple away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His action, without a doubt, meant that he had accepted Li Qiye’s position and title!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Highness!” The spectators got on the ground and shouted in unison. Their cries echoed all over Mortal Emperor and triggered more kneeling and praise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this split second, Li Qiye’s status has been confirmed even before his official ascension and shouldering of the Heaven’s Will!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an unprecedented miracle. No one had been accepted so readily by all experts before the official coronation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no need for the Heaven’s Will. In the eyes of the people here, the Prime Emperor had proven his invincibility!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rise.” Li Qiye took in everything around him and said slowly. His quiet voice permeated all corners in the nine worlds. His imperial aura filled every inch of the lands. All cultivators were willing to submit to the Prime Emperor’s authority!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They finally stood up and looked at the emperor with awe and respect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and looked at the Heaven’s Will in the sky. He said: “It’s time to leave.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, his forehead lit up. One could see three golden, silver, and iron strands of light twisting together. The light of the Heaven’s Will was only one step of a long path compared to them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The end of the world is waiting to be vanquished by us!” He declared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Three maelstroms instantly pierced through all space and appeared above Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” The nine worlds quaked in response. All living beings were startled by the explosions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three maelstroms were hovering above his head now with their respective color - gold, silver, and iron. They were found by him in the past. The golden maelstrom came from the source of the three great veins in Stone Medicine. The silver one was located in the Ancestral Domain of Sacred Nether and the iron one was lost in the Bonesea.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Few people in history knew about them because they have never appeared at the same time. It was difficult to comprehend them, even an emperor would need a long period of time. More importantly, luck was essential in doing so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were related to the greatest mystery of the ages. The master in the Immortal Demon Grotto searched for it back then. In the beginning, he didn’t have a great understanding of the maelstroms. He only knew bits and pieces from the lost epochs, only about their existence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, his Dark Crow dug deeper and he understood them more. By the time the Dark Crow escaped from the grasp of the grotto, Li Qiye had greater knowledge than the grotto.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t until he obtained the silver light that he truly understood it. This was the reason why he wanted to go to Stone Medicine and Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these three maelstroms were rotating, the entire nine worlds were shaking as if the three could devour and grind everything to dust.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The maelstroms were small relative to the nine worlds but they contained a power a hundredfold stronger to the horror of all creatures. Everyone was afraid that they would suck the nine worlds in. From then on, nothing would exist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.” The three lights turned into three extremely tiny laws after a dazzling process. These hair-like laws were exquisite and looped around each other.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The three big maelstroms changed. They turned into three grand dao that have never been seen before.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short time, the three grand dao imitated the three tiny laws and twisted together without stopping. With their rotation, everything in the world became eternal as well. The explosions finally stopped and the world became quiet.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These grand dao were inscrutable. They seemed to have been born in the primordial essence, even older than the heaven and earth. All the laws and dao of the epochs were derived from them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could understand them and felt that in this particular conjoined state, the world was born for their sake. Li Qiye smiled satisfyingly after seeing this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for his search under the grotto’s command, he wouldn’t have figured out their mystery. During his search, he read through countless scrolls in the nine worlds and even went to the tenth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was virtually nothing written about them, only a few lines on ancient murals. After the long years, Li Qiye had certain guesses and today, he was finally successful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their origin and usage couldn’t be described with words. This was the reason why after losing, the grotto tried hard to find the maelstroms. In the master’s eyes, this was his only chance to rise again. Those who truly understood the maelstroms would go crazy, including emperors!</span></p>
