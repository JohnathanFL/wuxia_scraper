<p><b>Chapter 1294: Wooden Coffin</b></p><p>“Speak, there are few items in this world that I can’t afford.” Li Qiye slowly said: “Of course, you need to act sensibly. Don’t push it and lose the opportunity.”</p><p>Both Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi were very curious after seeing how much Li Qiye valued the coffin. What the hell was in this coffin?</p><p>Xiong Qianbei hesitated for a bit before biting his teeth and making up his mind: “I do not dare to be greedy after being shown such kindness by Young Noble. I, I want a piece of land.”</p><p>The two girls were surprised by this request. They both assumed Qianbei would want some treasures, elixirs or supreme merit laws, not a landmass.</p><p>“Do you know how precious a piece of land in Heaven Spirit is?” Jianshi shook her head. This was a world where land was more precious than anything else.</p><p>Qianbei replied: “This lowly one knows that. I won’t push my luck, I will be satisfied with a landmass around one hundred square miles.”</p><p>“You’re not pushing your luck by asking for a piece of land the size of one hundred square miles?” Ruyan couldn’t help but laugh while shaking her head: “Do you know how valuable this much land is in Heaven Spirit?”</p><p>Of course, a one hundred square mile piece of land was nothing in the other worlds. Even the minor branches of sects in those places would be much bigger. An ordinary disciple would be in charge of a territory of this size. However, land was too scarce in the Heaven Spirit World. This little piece of earth became especially precious here.</p><p>“A lot of second and third tier sects only have islands this big.” Jianshi gently shook her head.</p><p>“This old one knows.” Qianbei coughed in response: “However, this is a wooden coffin that incited a heavenly phenomenon. A meteor in the sky and a trench at the bottom of the sea — such a phenomenon is quite rare in this world. I believe this coffin is absolutely extraordinary, so I don’t think trading it for a one hundred square mile landmass is unreasonable.”</p><p>Ruyan grinned and said: “Even if it is worth the trade, you still need to have the power to handle it. You might be paying with your life before getting the chance to reap the benefits.”</p><p>She was telling the truth. If others knew that this coffin was truly worth a small island, many people would definitely try to rob him.</p><p>“Well…” Qianbei played the fool to avoid this question.</p><p>Li Qiye chuckled and flatly asked: “Even if I give you an island of that size, would you be able to keep it?”</p><p>Without sufficient strength, such a landmass would simply be a prize to compete for in Heaven Spirit. The old man could be robbed of it at any moment!</p><p>Qianbei solemnly answered: “Young Noble, I will try my best to guard it. If I have a piece of land, I will be able to reform my Xiong Clan. I shall treat it as my lifeblood.”</p><p>After seeing his serious demeanor, Li Qiye smiled and slowly said: “You desire a piece of land? So be it, I shall give it to you!”</p><p>“Really?” Qianbei couldn’t believe it. In fact, he didn’t place too much hope in this request. It was simply absurd, so Li Qiye accepting the trade made him think that this was a dream.</p><p>Li Qiye replied: “My words are made of gold, what I say shall be done.”</p><p>After hearing his resolute tone, Qianbei was ecstatic and quickly bowed: “Young Noble, this is giving us a new life. We shall remember your kindness for generations to come.”</p><p>Li Qiye didn’t care for such pleasantries and ordered: “Give me the coffin.”</p><p>“Well…” Qianbei hesitated. After all, he still hadn’t received the land yet, so he didn’t want to hand over the wooden coffin first.</p><p>Li Qiye continued: “Don’t worry, I said that I would give you a landmass, so I will when I’m done with my business.”</p><p>“Young Noble Li is a man of his word.” Jianshi added: “Our Sacred Spring School can guarantee you that he will give you what you want.”</p><p>“My Evil Devourer School will do the same, so you can rest assured.” Ruyan smiled as well.</p><p>Qianbei was glad to hear these two. They were both schoolmasters from an extremely reputable sect in Heaven Spirit. He could rest easy when these two put forth their guarantee for Li Qiye.</p><p>He hurriedly placed the coffin in front of Li Qiye and respectfully said: “Young Noble, the coffin is now yours.”</p><p>Having said that, he respectfully stood to the side. Li Qiye gave him the side-eye, but Qianbei didn’t react.</p><p>Liu Ruyan looked at him and teased: “What now, are you still afraid of not getting your land?”</p><p>Qianbei shamelessly stood there and smiled: “No, Schoolmaster, please don’t misunderstand me. I trust the young noble and you two schoolmasters as well. Ah, everyone must be going to the Bonesea this time, correct? I also want to go broaden my horizons. If you need an errand boy or a coolie, I am ready to serve.”</p><p>Li Qiye lazily looked at him and casually commented: “Such a shameless disciple has probably never appeared in the Xiong Clan until now.”</p><p>“Agh…” Qianbei’s face turned a bit hot, but he was too thick-skinned and continued to stand there while playing dumb.</p><p>Li Qiye ignored him and stood up. He circled around the coffin to carefully read the runes.</p><p>Ruyan curiously speculated: “What’s in it? Don’t tell me it is just a corpse.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s a treasury.” Qianbei couldn’t help but join in: “But how can you open it? I used all of my strength to hit it, but that didn’t do anything.”</p><p>“I’d like to have a try.” Ruyan’s competitive nature rose. She stepped forward and placed both hands on the coffin while channeling her merit law. With her blood energy rising, a loud explosion ensued. She used a mighty force to lift it, aiming to remove the lid.</p><p>One must know that with her strength, she could easily overturn a mountain. Her going all out would result in an unimaginable power that could only be described by the phrase, “hating the earth for not having a circular handle.” [1. This is a peculiar phrase — hating the earth for not having a circular handle. It is describing someone with so much energy and power that if there was a handle for the earth, they could swing the earth around. The other part of this phrase is a hiltless heaven. Hiltless heaven and handleless earth — describing an overwhelming power.]</p><p>This force could tear apart the earth and rend the sky vault. However, even with her using all of her might, she couldn’t remove the lid of this coffin.</p><p>“How can this be?” To Ruyan’s astonishment, there wasn’t the slightest sign of damage or fingerprint on it. Showboating was not in her nature, but she was quite confident in her own power.</p><p>“Just what is this coffin?” Jianshi was shocked as well. They grew up and regularly competed against each other, so Jianshi understood Ruyan’s strength. Not even Godkings could stop characters of their level.</p><p>“This is beyond your comprehension.” Li Qiye smiled: “In terms of forcefully opening it, not to mention the two of you, even an Immortal Emperor might not be able to do it.”</p><p>This comment surprised both of the girls. What a monstrous claim! Anyone else would think that Li Qiye was just exaggerating, but they actually believed him.</p><p>“What the hell is inside?” Qianbei was completely drawn in. Even though he was the one who found the coffin, he didn’t know what was inside or what was so special about it.</p><p>“We’ll find out soon enough.” Li Qiye chuckled and placed his palm on the coffin, then he slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>His palm remained unmoving. He didn’t release a crazy amount of blood energy or unstoppable laws and dao. It was simply him touching the coffin.</p><p>As moments passed, Li Qiye seemed to be caught in a deep sleep. Everyone else held their breaths; they didn’t want to break his concentration.</p><p>Even more time went on while the three remained completely quiet. Qianbei was a bit disappointed after thinking that this coffin might not be opened so easily.</p><p>However, at this very second, the runes came together to form the image of a tree of life. A majestic life force engulfed the area as if something was returning to life.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
