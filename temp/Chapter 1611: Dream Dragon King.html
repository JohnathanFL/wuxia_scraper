Such rumors were very unfavorable for them. After all, Zi Cuining would become their mistress in the future or even the imperial queen. That’s why they didn’t wish to hear such gossips regardless of whether they were true or not.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For their sect right now, the best outcome was to kill Fiercest!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you two are old friends, then please come.” After contemplating for a moment, the instructor replied.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh: “That’s how it should be, the style of a lineage with five emperors. This is more presentable.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instructor wasn’t willing to respond.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Soaring Immortal is actually relenting!” The spectators faraway were actually startled to see the sect allowing Li Qiye to see Zi Cuining.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one expected this particular development. They thought the instructor would try to stop him then a massacre would ensue.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, they unexpected conceded to the astonishment of the crowd. The sect had been domineering after descending into this region with an unstoppable conquest against the demons. They had no qualms moving against anyone until now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The validity of the scandal between Li Qiye and the goddess didn’t matter. Most importantly, she was about to marry Long Aotian but Li Qiye decided to interfere at this crucial moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This meant that as long as Fiercest was still alive, he would be a smudge on Soaring Immortal’s reputation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiercest might be the only person who can force Soaring Immortal to concede.” Someone murmured.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A disciple now led the way for Li Qiye who was all smiles. He and the monarch casually entered the sect’s territory. Anyone else would treat this place like the lion’s den. They would surely be prepared for him but Fiercest was completely indifferent, drawing even more admiration from the crowd.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the contrary, Soaring Immortal was ready for battle. The disciples here didn’t dare to relax at all. They had full battle adornment ready and guarded their positions. This was because Fiercest was too notorious. Everyone knew of his bloodstained hands.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was someone who would destroy a sect after some unfriendly words so how could Soaring Immortal not be careful? They didn’t want to be like the disciples on the Skyfire Warships, crushed like a pulp and dead without a grave!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long before the disciple took him to an old pavilion. It was floating in the air with a stairway made of clouds. It was heavily guarded with experts from Heaven Suppression instead of Soaring Immortal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Noble Li, I can only take you here.” The Soaring Immortal disciple quietly left after taking him here.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a wise move from the instructor. He didn’t want to confront Li Qiye directly and instead threw the problem at Heaven Suppression. It was the city’s choice now whether he can see the goddess or not.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his opinion, the marriage between Cuining and Aotian had been decided by the high-ranking ancestors from the two sects. No one could change this outcome.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, he was confident that Fiercest wouldn’t be able to break this marriage alliance either.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For this alliance to work, Heaven Suppression must also be on their side when dealing with Fiercest.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Halt, who are you?!” The guards protecting the pavilion immediately pointed their weapons at Li Qiye as he drew closer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, they were aware of the situation and who they were facing. Nevertheless, they must not let him see Zi Cuining. They weren’t here to protect her but to isolate her from contacting outsiders.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone of her power level didn’t need the protection from these experts. They were only under Ye Jiuzhou’s order to avoid any potential complication before the marriage was done.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Jiuzhou’s preparation wasn’t meant for Fiercest, only the other dissenters from Heaven Suppression. If he knew Fiercest was going to be coming, he would have personally presided over the area.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good dogs don’t block the way.” Li Qiye glanced at the prepared forces and smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A youth came out from the guards. He was well-dressed with a high crest while radiating a dazzling light with the powerful aura of a noble.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Li, our city lord isn’t seeing guests, please leave.” The youth didn’t back down even before Fiercest.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dream Dragon King, Ye Jiuzhou’s favorite disciple.” The experts nearby recognized him right away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s quite strong for being so young, already a half completion Immortal Physique on top of training the other amazing arts from Heaven Suppression. It’s a shame that the goddess is too talented so he was doomed to be under her shadow.” An expert who knew him said with a tinge of emotion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was almost a tragedy for the Dream Dragon King because his incredible achievements looked less impressive before Zi Cuining. He couldn’t become the city lord.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not up to you and not up to her either. If I say I want to see her, I shall.” Li Qiye stared at him and declared nonchalantly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” The king’s expression turned ugly. He found it hard to swallow this anger when someone came to the Grand Sea and treated Heaven Suppression in this manner.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite knowing Fiercest, his sect was no slouch either. Moreover, his master and grandmaster were Ye Jiuzhou and Gu Zun, respectively.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, everything has a limit, you shouldn’t be too aggressive or you will have no place left to go one day, despite how vast the nine worlds are!” The king took a deep breath and didn’t want to concede. He answered with the perfect tone, neither supercilious nor obsequious.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need to get all philosophical with me.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “I don’t care about reasons. I will count to five, if you don’t make way, I’ll kill you all.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts here weren’t happy to hear such contempt coming from a junior, evident by their angry glare.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine, Li Qiye, I’ll check out your supreme arts!” The king didn’t back off and was ready to fight to the death. He had received the orders from his master to not let anyone see the city lord!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are not his match, get back.” Zi Cuining appeared on the pavilion above and gravely said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The king hesitated and stood there quietly. He wasn’t in the position to disobey her publicly.
