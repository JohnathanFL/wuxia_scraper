The last time was before Immortal Emperor Yin Tian’s ascension to the throne.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even ancestors were shocked: “Not just anyone can call for this convention, what’s the reason this time? Who is qualified to preside over this meeting?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another piece of news answered this particular question: “The son of a sea god and the vice ancestor of the treants, they are capable of presiding over a convention of myriad races.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some grand characters were alarmed and murmured: “Is the storm coming now?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right, the storm is coming. All enemies of us charming spirits, treants, and sea demons should be eradicated! Heaven Spirit must have the next emperor!” This declaration stirred the people.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The younger generation had never heard of this matter, so they asked out of confusion: “What kind of convention is this?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A senior explained: “There are two major points to this convention. First, all races can participate. Second, it is to deal with the problems of Heaven Spirit. This convention is very majestic and important. Generally speaking, the less influential people can only sit on the sidelines and watch without being able to make decisions…</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“... They will discuss all the grand matters in Heaven Spirit. Of course, the final say is up to the behemoths behind closed doors; they will announce the result to everyone at the convention.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A junior replied: “So a lineage like ours will merely be listeners...”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The senior nodded: “Yes, not too many people can actually make decisions at this convention. The rest of the participants are only there to hear the resolutions in order to avoid problems while implementing these decisions and to reduce further conflicts between the races. Normally, the decisions made there could affect all of Heaven Spirit…</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“... For example, the Lithodidae Sea God. After the battle at the War Cliff, his position was fortified. Afterward, a convention of myriad races was held and the sea demons, treants, and charming spirits recognized his status. From then on, no more lineages directly tried to compete with him by stealing the Trident. Because of this, he was able to wipe out all obstacles and become the next sea god.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the purpose of this one then?” The junior was unavoidably curious.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The senior didn’t answer this time and fell into silence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ego King, the convention of myriad races is about to begin, do you want to go listen?” After hearing this news, Xiaoxiao immediately told Li Qiye and cheerfully smiled: “I heard a sea god’s son and the vice ancestor of the treants are in charge. It looks like they are going to deal with you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Convention of myriad races? More like a convention of a massacre.” Li Qiye smiled: “It is best if they want to scheme against me so that I can kill all of them at once. There will be fewer problems that way.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Yonghuang reminded him: “I’m afraid the enemies want you to do just that. They are digging a pit and waiting for you to jump in so that they can make you the enemy of all the races in Heaven Spirit.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After several days of recuperation, her injuries were much better.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed in response: “So what if this is a trap? Nothing can be better, there can only be more enemies. Slaughter a hundred thousand and they will think they can still fight. Kill a million and they would still think that there is a chance for retaliation. However, if you kill billions, all of Heaven Spirit will shut up. Silence will finally come.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s only a couple races. Just wait until I begin the massacre, people will soon figure out which side is the right one. Obey me and live, disobey me and die. Those who stand in my way shall be killed without mercy! It doesn’t matter if blood drowns this entire world.” He softly smiled at this point.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a stark and jarring contrast between his gentle smile and the cruel contents of his speech.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao, who just wanted to tease him, felt a chill after hearing his response. She believed that he wasn’t just speaking for fun, this was his intention from the start.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Yonghuang couldn’t do anything but wryly smile. She had grown accustomed to Li Qiye’s slaughtering wrath.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this split second, he raised his brows and told Yonghuang: “You want to kill Seashield, right? He will definitely go to this convention, so that will be your time to shine.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao added: “That scared Conch Overlord might be there to protect him.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye casually handed an item to Yonghuang and said: “Go find the True Martial Goddess. If that cowardly turtle dares to cause trouble, she will protect you. Kill the Seashield Prince at the convention to show everyone the fate of those who dare to attack my people!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, he turned and left. This surprised both of the girls.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After calming down, Yonghuang raised her voice: “Where are you going?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to see someone. Like I said before, don’t wait for me. If I don’t come back, just go back to your homes...” He disappeared into the sky before finishing his sentence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A shadow crossed the city’s sky. It was so fast that no one was able to detect it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Li Qiye immediately gave chase to this shadow. He could cross realms by utilizing the immeasurable speed of his Soaring Immortal Physique.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, he was able to catch up. It was the same woman who was drifting through the void. It looked as if she was walking slowly, but her speed was amazing. She looked like a strolling fairy with a wonderful posture — completely kingdom-toppling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fairy-like woman landed on a peak and turned around to coldly stare at Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye also stopped and met her gaze.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He said: “I’ve been waiting for you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was met with the same indifferent gaze and silence just like last time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He bitterly smiled after seeing this: “I know it was all my fault, but no matter what, I hope we can end this so that you can have closure before I leave.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” A sword left its sheath with its tip touching Li Qiye’s throat. If he moved even a tiny bit, it would immediately pierce through him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t panic at all. He slowly closed his eyes and sighed: “If killing me can take away the hatred in your heart, then go ahead. I won’t be mad at you even if you chop me into pieces.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You cultivate the Death Physique.” In the end, she finally spoke with a voice as heavenly as an immortal. Despite the cold intent, it was still very pleasant to the ears.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, you understand me too well.” Li Qiye chuckled without hiding anything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She coldly uttered: “Understand you?

However, she interrupted him: “You shouldn’t say it was all for my sake. I know you will say so since you always come up with an excuse! As the teacher of Immortal Emperors, you always come up with such perfect excuses!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He earnestly said: “First of all, I admit that I have deceived you. Second, whether you believe it or not, I only hope for you to live on. I have promised your father that as long as I am alive, no one can kill you. It’s fine if you don’t believe me.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She coldly asked: “You thought I was going to die?

Do you think both of you could have survived?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She retorted: “So you chose her.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t choose her.” He sincerely said: “When her invincible dao reached completion, I knew that she could suppress eternity itself.

Ultimately, I am fully responsible for what happened.”</span></p>
