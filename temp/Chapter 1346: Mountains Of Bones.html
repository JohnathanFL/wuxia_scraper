The boneships struck the surface right away and began to float. This process was too fast. It wasn’t a process of floating up from the bottom of the sea, it was entering from another world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An immense gust of wind assaulted everyone; it could only be described with the word “death”.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sisters and the daoist were all experienced members of society. However, they were shocked to see the scene ahead. Of course, they had read records in their sect describing the Bonesea. Alas, reading and personally seeing were two completely different matters.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">True to its name, this sea was full of bones! When standing above, regardless of the location, only bones were in sight. A sea made out of bones might be the most appropriate way to describe this region.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They piled into mountains, creating an astounding spectacle. Because of these piles, this sea seemed to be divided. It was difficult to see the whole ocean due to these bony protrusions. The visible water looked like narrow rivers, allowing the little ships to pass through the ghastly hills.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone would be creeped out while being so close to death. The more timid crowd would forever be stained with this shadow for the rest of their life. Stray bones were also floating among the cold splashing waves. The majority of the skeletons here remained relatively intact, making it seem as if something had eaten the flesh while leaving the bones behind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were all kinds of skeletons from different creatures, not just humans. Their varied shapes exceeded one’s imagination. Some were unreasonably large while others were wonderfully small. Looking around, one would see a small pheasant-like skeleton next to a mountain-sized skeleton. The large ones came in a variety as well. There was an elephant head with its ivory tusks stretched out for dozens of miles, and another looked just like a dragon. This might be an ancient python; it spanned for several thousand miles just like a mountain range. One could easily imagine just how large and mighty it used to be when it was alive.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a skeleton that looked like a peak protruding out of the sea all the way to the white clouds. A single glance wasn’t sufficient to discern the creature. However, upon closer inspection, one would find that this sky-piercing peak was only part of a finger, so just how large was the hand below the sea?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an example of gigantic humanoid skeletons beside great beasts. They looked just like continents half-immersed in the sea while their ribs looked like small mountain ranges.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These giants were true to the phrase “head wearing the sky and feet stomping the ground.” [1. Idiom used to describe heroic men. In this sense, it is more literal to describe the size of these skeletons.]</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan’s group was astounded to see it. They had imagined these kinds of giants in their minds before, but the real thing was simply too shocking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, the daoist emotionally commented: “So this is the Bonesea...” He felt that there was no title better for this place than “Bonesea.” The two girls were speechless for a while as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My god!” Qianbei was stunned and his legs went soft. He slumped down to the deck while shaking nonstop. With a pale complexion, he murmured: “Was this a world destruction? If all creatures in myriad realms die, it couldn’t be worse than this.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye calmly looked at it before answering with a faint smile: “The Bonesea is not the most dangerous among the twelve burial grounds, but it is definitely the cruelest.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan’s expression turned unnatural as she stood up and mumbled: “How did this happen? There are so many skeletons here... It’s not like every creature can come here to die.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t answer right away, he only continued his quiet contemplation. Eventually, he replied: “This is a place from a distant era where events more brutal than what you can imagine took place. Back then, all of these creatures were mere ants…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, all the cultivators on their boneships shared this mournful feeling. Even those who had been here before were shaken all the same and dumbfounded.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew what actually happened in this place and why there were so many bones. What happened to create such a scene? Everything had been buried in the endless river of time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, their imagination played a role in the depiction of what had transpired, much to their chagrin. They were creeped out by it; this would be a cause for many sleepless nights.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this moment when many spectators were dumbfounded, Fairy suddenly trembled as if she was hit by a blow and had to take several thumping steps back. Her body emitted a bright yet unstable brilliance like a candle in the wind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her changes woke the rest of the group from their rumination. Li Qiye, on the other hand, didn’t find this surprising. He immediately held her, paying close attention to any minute changes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not feeling good.” Her pale face had an unnatural demeanor that consisted of sadness, anger, confusion, and helplessness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This surprised everyone else. In their minds, she was absolutely invincible. Just one finger could easily defeat the diamond physique. Such an invincible character shouldn’t be scared by the Bonesea.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye helped her sit down and said in a serious manner: “Calm down, let your feelings flow. There’s no need to suppress or control it, let it tell you how to feel.” With that, he gently touched her forehead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It suddenly lit up as white as the moon. Her forehead seemed to be opening up a new world. With this development, the gentle light being exuded around her increased in purity. With the accompaniment of her smile, it seemed as if she was having a happy thought.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her beauty was unparalleled. Even Ruyan and Jianshi who were exceptionally pretty were overshadowed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she faintly smiled like this, it was the prettiest smile in the world and more than enough to drive anyone crazy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong with her?” Jianshi grew worried as well after seeing Fairy sitting like that on the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye answered: “She’s finding herself.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Finding herself?” Ruyan added: “You mean, she’s trying to find her own memories?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After her addition to the group, everyone could tell that she had amnesia, but they didn’t state it out loud.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye stared at Fairy and said: “It’s not that simple. She isn’t only trying to find her memories, and the process isn’t that easy. It requires a long period for her to settle down. I hope she will be able to surpass the tribulation of the past, otherwise…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Otherwise what?” Li Qiye’s sudden stop made the daoist’s heart skip a beat. He had an ominous feeling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye loudly laughed: “Just try to imagine what happens when an Immortal Emperor becomes angry. No, even worse, an existence above an Immortal Emperor going crazy, what do you think will happen?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye’s laughter made the daoist take several steps back from fear. He spoke with skepticism: “Are, are you joking?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had experienced Fairy’s might firsthand, and the fear still lingered in his mind. Li Qiye’s words just now horrified him completely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girls slightly trembled as well. This answer just now contained many hidden matters.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianbei was tongue-tied. This topic was too out-of-reach for him. Immortal Emperors — these were existences he didn’t dare to even think about.</span></p>
