Not to mention the other experts, even ancestors of the Godking level didn’t dare to say anything. This was a confrontation of the highest order.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anyone else?” After the Stygian Monarch came out, Li Qiye once again showed up with his overbearing avatar. He loomed over Heaven Spirit as his voice echoed: “Any more random dogs and cats willing to crawl out? If you want to fight, then come out already. I will take all of you on so just come, don’t waste my time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All who heard him took a deep breath without commenting. Li Qiye didn’t give a damn against these three existences and still boasted in front of the world as if he alone was untouchable. The word “domineering” wasn’t enough to describe his current bearing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I alone am invincible.” In the end, people could only use this common phrase to describe Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might be the only one who would dare to act without scruples like this against his opponents. Even Meng Zhentian wouldn’t dare to do so when he was alive.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He must have other unstoppable means that we haven’t seen yet.” An expert who had seen Li Qiye in action before speculated with dread.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Li Qiye also called Zhentian’s group random dogs and cats. Nevertheless, he stayed true to his words and slaughtered all of them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he was doing the same thing against Emperor Assailants. The crowd had learned that this wasn’t due to arrogance but absolute confidence and power. This meant that he didn’t use his full strength against Zhentian’s group and still had other tricks up his sleeves.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This thought scared many people. An ancestor murmured: “Just how strong is Li Qiye then? Is he really capable of challenging everything?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another speculated: “That’s probably the case. What can’t he do after coming up with thirteen palaces?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” An answer came to Li Qiye. A divine light soared from the Dream Empyrean and a bright moon emerged. It was gigantic and encompassed the entire territory of the sect. From a distance, it looked just like a planet with the shape of a moon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its light illuminated all of Heaven Spirit. Even the sun hanging up high dimmed in the presence of this bright light.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, don’t think Heaven Spirit has no one to stop you. I, Shen Mengtian, will take you on!” A voice erupted and made everyone dizzy!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” Someone screamed after hearing this: “Shen Mengtian? Isn’t, isn’t he dead already?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Mengtian — when this name echoed across Heaven Spirit, many sealed undyings underground were shaken. No one expected this development.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why is Shen Mengtian still alive?” Some undyings couldn’t believe their ears and were stunned.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-af3b"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Mengtian was the Dream Empyrean’s progenitor. He came from the Spirit Abyss and created his own sect later using his own name. </span></span><a href="#footnote-af3b">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a rumor that he has cultivated his divine reflection to the limit. Some even believed that he had the highest achievement in this aspect out of all the charming spirits.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, he could derive and calculate everything. Emperors had asked him and borrowed his ability to figure out some mysteries.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, Shen Mengtian was called an immortal teacher by future generations because some emperors referred to him in this manner out of respect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, he stopped appearing so people thought he was dead. Even a lot of disciples from his own sect believed this. Thus, his sudden appearance took everyone by surprise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A centipede just won’t give up. Looks like this old geezer has been trying all this time without dying.” Another ancient being murmured: “It appears that he needs the nine leaves for the final gamble before death.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye’s avatar looked at the moon above the Dream Empyrean and smiled: “Shen Mengtian, right? Come, I’m waiting. Anyone else? One last chance to join in. Miss the chance today and there will be no more!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people in the world wryly smiled after seeing his eager appearance. Anyone else would be pissing their pants in fear if they had to face this many powerful foes, but he didn’t give a damn.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Count this old man in.” A tired voice came about with the appearance of an ordinary old man.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Imperial Dualchild!” Many recognized him right away because he showed up at the Reincarnation Valley before.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, you’re in. Is that it? Anyone else want to fight?” Li Qiye revealed a carefree grin and looked around once more.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this brief period of time, the world went silent. Everyone knew that only the strongest characters in Heaven Spirit were eligible to participate. These were apex existences, the most mighty experts outside of Immortal Emperors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one answered him after this final call. Not just anyone was qualified to enter this war.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, so just the five of you.” Li Qiye laughed: “Come and do your best, this is your last chance. Five days later at the Broken God Cliff, I’ll be waiting!” With that, his avatar disappeared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Five days later at the Broken God Cliff!” This news spread across Heaven Spirit like a storm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An expert asked his peer: “Shall we go watch?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you insane?! Even if you are standing outside of the cliff, a remnant gale alone will annihilate you instantly. People like us can’t watch a battle of this level. Only Godkings can.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Focus on the cliff right now! I don’t care how many refined jades we have to use, open the heavenly mirror right now and lock onto it!” Many imperial lineages and ancient sects hastily made this decision.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, come. Five invincible masters against Li Qiye. The victor will be determined in five days.” Many bets surfaced overnight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Going against five by himself, can Li Qiye do it? They’re all Emperor Assailants. I don’t think anyone nowadays can take on all five at the same time.” Those who held Li Qiye in high regard felt worried.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He definitely can. Just look at his thirteen palaces.” Some of his supporters had blind faith and thought that he was omnipotent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye’s victory is imminent for he is unbeatable.” Some crazy fans even started a slogan for him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the majority of the great powers were very careful. Even the sects who wanted to get close to him had to pause.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their eyes, if Li Qiye were to lose, it would be a disaster for them to pick his side.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the world was in a furor, Li Qiye was relaxing back at the True Martial Island with Tantai Ruonan by his side. It was a moon viewing party.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruonan smiled and began: “Young Master, you’re finally going all out this time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not quite. I’m just baiting some snakes from their caves so that I can conveniently destroy the Ancestral Terra. Since this is a lineage with three ancestral trees, I want to see how the Divine Tree Ridge will react after I destroy them.” Li Qiye couldn’t help himself from smiling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If outsiders were to hear this, their faces would turn pale instantly.
