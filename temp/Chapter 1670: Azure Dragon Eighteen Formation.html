They were able to threaten the nine worlds while no one else dared to criticize them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, eight legions were present at the same time.

He said respectfully: “Your fame resounds like the thunder and we are forever in reverence of the Azure Dragon Legion’s tales. Unfortunately, we must fight you because we have our orders."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-55b1"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ma Zhenwen was an unknown name to the youths but an old God-Monarch from the alliance had heard of it and shouted in astonishment: “The Soaring Horse General.”&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-55b1">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This name was more popular with the old characters. Though he was not the strongest general under the emperor, he had the most contributions, He once destroyed ten sects, eight countries, and one imperial lineage within one night. This made him quite notorious and granted him this nickname.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good. Come and witness the destruction of Soaring Immortal.” Worldkeeper calmly said as if this was no big deal.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If such words came from anyone else, the generals would be in a furor right now.

This was a legion that could stop the Ancient Ming. It was indeed eligible to challenge their sect. It could even be said that Ma Zhenwen felt like the underdog in this fight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Start the formation.” He didn’t waste time and took a deep breath before giving out the command.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.” Endless light surged out from the platforms and jumped onto the members of the eight legions. Each expert became shrouded in this light and gained a divine armor. They looked just like gods now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With an explosion of an imperial power, the eight legions came together with the front and the back sides meeting to form a circle. In a short time, the legions seemingly disappeared from the platforms. Next, all one could see was a forest of weapons, a thicket of destruction. This was an ultimate formation sealing all the platforms.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would be exceedingly difficult to forge a path out of this formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the fatal danger surrounding him, Worldkeeper calmly ordered: “Azure Dragon Eighteen Formation.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” The entire legion turned into an Azure Dragon in the blink of an eye. This gigantic dragon took over the platforms that were now a death zone due to the Soaring Immortal Legion. There were shadows of spears and blades everywhere. Every single step was filled with danger.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The Soaring Immortal Legion suddenly appeared again in the form of a saber formation trying to make mincemeat of their enemy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was indeed capable of chopping everything into thin slices of meat with such fast speed that they would still be moving after the severing process.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the horde of blades was coming, Worldkeeper gave an order: “Dragon To The Sky!”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dragon leaped upward. Though the eight legions have sealed the platforms, it still couldn’t stop the movement of this draconic formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a single jump, Azure Dragon instantly dodged the saber formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Raaar!” The dragon descended and clawed at the formation. The unbelievably sharp claws slashed the chest of many experts in the imperial legion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff!” Blood went flying. Some generals couldn’t evade in time and were torn into two pieces. They didn’t even have the chance to scream.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Soaring Immortal retaliated against this powerful offense of the dragon. Their formation instantly turned into a Heaven Suppression Seal that rushed down from the sky to stop this beast.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky suddenly turned black with the emergence of the seal. Followers were chanting to the seal of an emperor. This looked like an imperial decree, all must prostrate at its sight. All evils would be annihilated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Raaa!” The dragon roared and became enraged. A terrible draconic aura engulfed the sky. At this time, the dragon had an imperceptible speed.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a deafening blast, the Heaven Suppression Seal was torn into pieces. Next came a series of screamings. The dragon turned into six copies and ravaged all directions. In the blink of an eye, the supreme formation was torn asunder.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Azure Dragon Eighteen Formation. First, it went from “Dragon In The Wild” and changed to “Season Of Six Dragons”.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, the eight legions emerged again.

Their supreme formation was much weaker while his eighteen formations were just as strong as before on its new debut.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rawrr!” The six dragons continued to scream and rampaged on the battlefield. The eight legions were being massacred.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill!” Despite not being a match, Soaring Immortal was still struggling to hold on.

In the beginning, Soaring Immortal didn’t care for the alliance but now, they were being stomped down by the alliance. Many generals from Soaring Immortal angrily gritted their teeth but there was nothing they could do about it. The majority of their forces was being used to stop Azure Dragon and had no time to deal with the alliance!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” Soaring Immortal was no match for the fury of the eighteen formations from Azure Dragon. They were continuously pushed back!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soaring Immortal suffered grievous losses in a short time. Many disciples were being massacred to the dismay of the old generals from the imperial legions. This was truly humiliating to them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Open the formation, use our vitality!” In the end, an order-giver from the sect couldn’t endure this any longer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After receiving the command, the soldiers offered their blood energy without any hesitation into the battlefield.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had no other choice at this moment. It was either being killed one by one by the legion or to go all out. This was a heavy price to pay but at least there was a chance. Once it was time for their ace card to come out, perhaps they would be able to destroy Azure Dragon and put an end to the legend!</span></p><div id="footnote-55b1"><p>1.
