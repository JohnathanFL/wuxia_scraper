<p>The news of a new prime disciple had spread across the sect. The upper echelons were unhappy, but they couldn’t do anything with regards to this matter due to the ancient order. A useless person like Li Qiye was only lucky, that was all.</p><p>However, the third generation was extremely riled up. The prime disciple would have originally been one of them and would have to be the one with the greatest contributions as well as one who passed all the tests given by the elders.</p><p>He would be blessed with the sect master’s teachings and gain exposure to emperor level techniques. Ultimately, he would most likely become the sect master in the future.</p><p>In the current situation, no one within the second generation of disciples was chosen, meaning that the prime disciple would definitely be chosen from the third generation disciples.</p><p>The ones that rebelled the most were the most gifted disciples with the highest aptitudes and origins; they felt cheated by Li Qiye. Thus, the commotion in the sect was chaotic.</p><p>A few geniuses angrily declared: “A mortal with a mortal physique, mortal life wheel, and mortal fate palace has no right to be the prime disciple.”</p><p>Another talented youth added: “He is the biggest disgrace to our sect.”</p><p>“Who can blame him for obtaining the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order? Even the elders have accepted it.” A few of the older geniuses lamented, but they could only accept the situation.</p><p>“Hmph, he is only the prime disciple for now. One without talent and strength cannot compete for the sect master’s seat. Who is to say that the prime disciple will certainly become the next sect master?” The most arrogant and confident disciples shared this sentiment.</p><p>Someone who was a bit eager spoke: “If he doesn’t know right from wrong, I wouldn’t mind teaching him a little bit.”</p><p>Even when Li Qiye really didn’t have the qualifications to compete for the sect master’s seat, all the disciples still felt cheated inside when they have to call a useless youth like Li Qiye “First Brother”.</p><p>A disciple curiously asked: “Isn’t the last remaining Cleansing Incense Ancient Order in the hands of Old Devil? How did it fall into the hands of that little brat?”</p><p>The fact that Old Devil possessed the last order was not a big secret. The sect had always wanted to reclaim it, but Old Devil never agreed. This was why everyone was perplexed about it coming into Li Qiye’s possession.</p><p>Another disciple coldly replied: “Hehe, I heard that this brat has some wit, I just don’t know how he fooled the perverted old man.</p><p>“I heard that when the elders ordered people to confirm this matter, Old Devil was having fun in the brothel. It could very well be that the brat invited him to play as much as he wanted in order to trade for the ancient order.” Here, this disciple scowled and felt nauseous.</p><p>Hearing this story, the other disciples contemptuously exclaimed: “So he and that perverted old man are the same!”</p><p>Even though rumor has it that Old Devil was a child of a certain sect master, the entire sect did not welcome such a perverted old man that only knew how to spend money and fool around. This was especially true for the third generation disciples, they did not have the slightest bit of respect for him. If it wasn’t for the will of the last sect master, he would have been kicked out of the sect already.</p><p>If Li Qiye and Old Devil were the same type of people, then they would find Li Qiye even more distasteful.</p><p>Three days has yet to pass and Li Qiye had not yet greeted the ancestor, but the sect received an invitation from the Nine Saint Demon Gate.</p><p>“What! The Nine Saint Demon Gate wants to test Li Qiye?” After receiving the news, the six elders were shocked.</p><p>One of the elders became increasingly paranoid and lamentably spoke: “They’ve heard the news so quickly. He only became the prime disciple recently, yet they already want to test him.”</p><p>Another elder chimed in: “It seems like they want to escape the promise of the past. A piece of trash like Li Qiye will never pass their test. That is why they want to force and expedite the issue.”</p><p>“We no longer have a choice.” The first elder reluctantly spoke: “Right now, the Nine Saint Demon Gate rules an entire country. We cannot compare to them, so we are not in a position to negotiate.”</p><p>His words caused everyone to fall into silence. In the beginning of the Emperors Era, their sect was invincible, their reputation intoxicated the Nine Worlds, and their strength allowed them to rule an ancient kingdom. All other sects submitted to their might. No existence in the entire world could have been a threat to the position of the old Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>However, the glories of old disappeared with the passage of time. They no longer had the power to rule a regular country, let alone an ancient kingdom. They lost the privilege of granting titles such as Named Hero or Royal Noble to their followers.</p><p>Another elder asked: “What do we do now?”</p><p>All of the elders knew that a mortal like Li Qiye had no chance of passing the examination from the Nine Saint Demon Gate.</p><p>“Cure a dead horse into a living one, there’s no other choice!” Another elder answered: “If he somehow succeeds, then we would become in-laws with the Nine Saint Demon Gate. If this were to be the case, then the Heavenly God Sect and the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom would not dare to look down upon us.”</p><p>Towards this impossible dream, the six elders could only forcefully laugh. No matter what, they still had to try.</p><p>***</p><p>Li Qiye was waiting in his villa for the ancestor’s ceremony when Nan Huairen approached him.</p><p>Nan Huairen quickly reported: “First Brother, the elders are calling for you in the grand chamber.”</p><p>Li Qiye nonchalantly asked: “Did something major happen?”</p><p>Nan Huairen was a bit surprised, but he didn’t hide anything. He nodded and replied: “I will not lie to you, First Brother. The Nine Saint Demon Gate sent us an invitation.”</p><p>He paused for a second and glanced at Li Qiye before continuing: “I heard your fiancee wants to test your abilities.”</p><p>“Nine Saint Demon Gate!” Li Qiye suddenly recalled an old memory when he heard this name.</p><p>Nan Huairen thought Li Qiye didn’t know of this sect, so he quickly explained: “The Nine Saint Demon Gate is one of the biggest sects in the Grand Middle Territory. They rule over the Old Ox Country and has the rights to grant titles. Our two sects used to have an amicable and close relationship. The original patriarch of Nine Saint used to be called the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon. He was the number one general under our Immortal Emperor Min Ren and followed him to sweep through the Nine Worlds. When we ruled over an ancient kingdom, even the Nine Saint Demon Gate had to pay tributes to us.”</p><p>“I have heard of the sect.” Li Qiye gently smiled. How could he not know about the sect? Moreover, he had met the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon as well.</p><p>During the early days of the Emperors Era, Li Qiye spent an absurd amount of time and energy to trap this demonic monster named Nine Saint and forced him to be Min Ren’s fate protector.</p><p>Li Qiye asked: “Where did this fiancee come from?”</p><p>Nan Huairen answered: “From the legends of when our patriarch accepted the Heaven’s Will and became the Immortal Emperor, the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon formed a pact with us. If their prime descendant was female while ours was male, we would become in-laws.”</p><p>After pausing for a moment, he dejectedly sighed: “At that time, they were climbing up the ranks.”</p><p>“I think that in the past, the Old Chicken had a female disciple.” After listening, Li Qiye quietly mumbled once again while recalled the past. He had forgotten about it after falling into deep sleep as it wasn’t a matter of great importance.</p><p>“What did you say, Great Brother?” Nan Huairen inquired since he didn’t hear it.</p><p>Li Qiye smoothly averted the inquiry: “Nothing. So their prime descendant right now is a woman?”</p><p>“It is known that between the two of our sects, there has not existed any in-law relationships for a long time. In this era, their prime descendant is indeed a woman.” He paused for a second to look at Li Qiye’s expression: “I also hear that their descendant, Li Shuangyan, has an innate king physique.”</p><p>Hearing Nan Huairen’s story, Li Qiye had a complete understanding of the situation. The Nine Saint Demon Gate naturally didn’t want to marry off a descendant with such an aptitude and potential to a disciple of a declining sect.</p><p>Li Qiye slightly chuckled: “That makes things a little more interesting.”</p><p>Nan Huairen shockingly stared at the calm Li Qiye. He felt strange that an ordinary boy at the age of thirteen was able to face everything like a Royal Noble who had gone through numerous trials.</p><p>If it was someone else having heard Nan Huairen’s words, they would become anxious, frightened even. However, Li Qiye completely betrayed common sense and carried on with his nonchalant attitude.</p><p>***</p><p>The first elder coldly asked once Li Qiye entered the ancestral chamber: “Has Nan Huairen informed you of the current situation?”</p><p>Truth be told, the six elders did not welcome a wastrel like Li Qiye. However, due to the current situation, they hoped that he wouldn’t be completely useless and that he could pass the trial of the Nine Saint Demon Gate through sheer luck. At this moment, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect truly needed a strong backing, such as becoming in-laws with a giant like the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Even though the chance of success was extremely small, they still wanted to try.</p><p>Li Qiye lightly nodded his head: “Honorable Elder, I understand completely.”</p><p>“Good! As long as you can pass the trial, we will handsomely reward you.” The first elder’s tone was as cold as ice as if to mock Li Qiye’s calm demeanor.</p><p>Li Qiye elegantly smiled and politely said: “I am very willing to attend the trial, but I have three conditions.”</p><p>“Impudent!” One of the elders yelled: “You dare to negotiate in front of the elders?”</p>
