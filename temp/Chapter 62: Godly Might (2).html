<p>Under these circumstances, right and wrong, along with black and white, were no longer important; even if Li Qiye was able to speak with lotus flowers in his words, he still wouldn’t be able to make things clear; even if he had one hundred mouths, he still wouldn’t be able to clear the accusation of master cheating ancestor killing and murder attempt of his senior.</p><p>The terrible thing was that Protector Hu was the first disciple of Elder Cao! The three sectional leaders were also from the camp of Elder Cao!</p><p>Luo Fenghua’s group immediately knew that this was a terrible trap when they thought back to a few days ago where Li Qiye taught a lesson to Leng Shizhi. They broke out in cold sweat from worrying for Li Qiye. This time, even if Li Qiye jumped into the Yellow river, it still wouldn’t be enough to cleanse this matter! <a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the law enforcement group had surrounded Li Qiye, with the leader being Leng Shizhi.</p><p>“Disrespectful! Master cheating ancestor killer! Sect betrayer! Kill him without mercy!” <a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a></p><p>Leng Shizhi stared intensely at Li Qiye; his eyes quivered with frightening killing intent!</p><p>Li Qiye smirked; he hadn’t yet made a move; however, Li Shuangyan coldly scowled as she took a step forward. Once she was in front, her blood energy pierced the heavens; it was as if a Heavenly King had woken up. Her body exuded a cold pressure that could freeze ten thousand miles in a flash.</p><p>Once Li Shuangyan walked forward, Leng Shizhi couldn’t help but to tremble, and he inadvertently took two steps back. He was the genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; however, when he was compared to Li Shuangyan, the difference was too drastic.</p><p>It wasn’t just Leng Shizhi; even the three sectional leaders and Protector Hu were shaking as well. In the end, this was the descendant and princess of the Old Ox country. This wasn’t someone with an undeserved reputation. She was a proud daughter of the heavens; even considering all of Grand Middle Territory, her reputation would still definitely be just as renowned.</p><p>“Princess Li, this is an internal matter of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. We are dealing with a traitor; please reconsider and do not interfere with our sect’s affair.” Protector Hu’s courage rose as he said this with a grave tone. He licked his lips as he thought about the backing behind him.</p><p>Li Shuangyan’s elegant yet cold countenance suddenly flashed a sharp brilliance. She naturally didn’t care about opposing the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.</p><p>Right then, Li Qiye let loose a smile, narrowed his eyes, and then he said: “It seems there are some that want me to step forward; fine, I will step out in front to say a few words. My two hands aren’t stained with blood, so others actually think that I am a nice person. Shuangyan, step back.”</p><p>Li Shuangyan glanced at Li Qiye, then repositioned herself behind his back without saying a word.</p><p>Seeing Li Shuangyan listen to all of Li Qiye’s orders, Leng Shizhi’s jealousy could pierce the heaven. He was maddened with jealousy. In his heart, Li Shuangyan was a goddess; a heavenly immortal in his mind. Even though she was so obedient towards a useless bag of straws, she instead had never looked at him.</p><p>Li Qiye stepped forward, brightly smiled at Leng Shizhi, and then he said: “No matter what kind of plots and devious plans you all are scheming, or the backings behind all of you, since it has deteriorated to the situation today, if I don’t kill a certain few, people will truly think that I am a pushover.”</p><p>Leng Shizhi coldly commanded: “You sect betraying, master cheating, ancestor killer! You are truly one deserving to be killed by all! Go, kill this traitor!” This signaled the law enforcement disciples that surrounded Li Qiye.</p><p>The surrounding disciples simultaneously yelled: “Traitor, lay down and accept your fate!” In the blink of an eye, they summoned their Life Treasures that flew straight at Li Qiye.</p><p>Each of the law enforcement disciple’s moves were fierce; their first move was to use their Life Treasures to slay Li Qiye. They essentially meant that they didn’t want Li Qiye to survive; they wanted to kill him on the spot.</p><p>“Scram…” The smiling eyes of Li Qiye suddenly became cold. In the blink of an eye, he flew upward like a giant Peng, and propped himself up; the heavens allowed for this Peng to fly. His body was in the air, and he used unpredictable steps in order to escape the Life Treasures that came from the law enforcement disciples.</p><p>A loud “Bang” sounded, and, just as Li Qiye had escaped the Life Treasures’ fire and thunder rays, his whole body ferociously struck down. This power was no longer in the realm of speed; in the middle of the fire and thunder rays, Li Qiye was akin to a massive Kun. One swing of its tail was enough to splash an entire ocean across ten thousand miles! <a href="#footnote_3">[3]</a></p><p>The appearance of the Kun, with its heavenly aura, caused a deafening noise to ring in the skies. The law enforcement disciples essentially couldn’t block the huge waves of the Kun. Under the assault of the powerful pressure, these disciples spewed out fresh blood, and they were all knocked away by giant waves.</p><p>“Kun Peng Minor Sixth Form; the last profound truth of the six moves…” Li Qiye had finished his move, and the eyes of the three sectional leaders and the protector couldn’t help but squint their eyes. Although the Kun Peng Minor Sixth Form was an incomplete Emperor merit law, to understand the last profound truth, even the most gifted disciple would still require decades in order to understand it!</p><p>Li Qiye jumped towards the middle with the heavenly Peng and gigantic Kun in a state of constant transformation; this matter was too frightening.</p><p>Li Qiye, with one move, had knocked away the law enforcement disciples, and then he landed on the ground. He staringly smiled at Leng Shizhi as he said: “Do you want to come alone, or do you want to come with the sectional leaders and Protector Hu?”</p><p>“Don’t be so arrogant; even if you understand the last profound truth, it is still only an insignificant technique.” Leng Shizhi’s eyes became cold, and he yelled: “Today, I will enlighten you on these things; you will find out what is truly a grand technique!”</p><p>Finished speaking, he opened his mouth wide to let out a Thirty Six Celestial Deities Sword. It immediately became a murderous forest-like sword formation that trapped Li Qiye in the middle.</p><p>“Thirty-Six Celestial Deities Sword formation…”</p><p>Seeing this sword formation, the Luo Fenghua crowd that had heard of this technique expressions couldn’t help but darken.</p><p>Thirty-Six Celestial Deities Sword formation was a technique created by an elder with the ranking of Ancient Saint. It was not just a merit law of Ancient Saint ranking, but it was also an extremely powerful Ancient Saint formation.</p><p>The Cleansing Jade Peak disciples didn’t think that Leng Shizhi, who was only a third generation disciple, would have the qualification to cultivate this merit law!</p><p>Li Shuangyan’s eyes also showed signs of concentration. She was staring intensely at Leng Shizhi’s sword formation. She could be called an expert regarding this realm, and after an analysis, she knew that Leng Shizhi had not understood one-tenth of this sword formation; the power was still considerable, however. Regardless, this was still an Ancient Saint sword formation.</p><p>Li Qiye suddenly was trapped in the sword formation. He smiled, and in the blink of an eye, he was as swift as a flying dragon and quick like a tiger’s steps. With this speed, he successfully escaped the sharp winds of the more-than-thirty swords with the two Invisible Dual Blades in his hands that were flying out and creating “Whoosh, Whoosh” sounds, while he was colliding and slashing at the thirty-six Celestial Deities Swords.</p><p>The sectional leaders and Protector Hu couldn’t believe their eyes. These Invisible Dual Blades, which were crafted from ordinary steel and collided with a Life Treasure, weren’t being damaged in the slightest. This was an unthinkable matter!</p><p>Seeing this scene, Leng Shizhi became angry, and he let out a deafening roar. He then activated a lethal technique in the sword formation: “Celestial Deities Imprisonment!”</p><p>“Clank, clank, clank!”</p><p>In a flash, the boundless sea of swords poured down in torrents that were accompanied by screams. At the moment the sword struck down diagonally, it was unstoppable. Once anything came into contact with the sword’s tip, it would immediately be pierced into millions of holes. This sword’s tip, that had an unstoppable momentum, pierced straight towards Li Qiye.</p><p>The pressure of this sword, without even mentioning Li Qiye’s body, was something that even someone with a Golden Body wouldn’t be able to resist. <a href="#footnote_4">[4]</a></p><p>At this moment, Li Qiye’s body moved at an inconceivable speed. The sword edge that was going to behead him was dodged by his sudden jump into the air; it was like his body was a Kun Peng when he jumped out of the Thirty Six Celestial Deities Sword formation!</p><p>In just a flash, Li Qiye had jumped out from the formation. Protector Hu knew his stuff; he spoke with a horrified expression: “Heavenly transformation! Kun Peng’s Six Variants…”</p><p>In the fire and thunder lights, Li Qiye had already jumped in front of Leng Shizhi. The Invisible Dual Blades’ cold reflection shimmered, and his left and right hands struck together straight for the head of Leng Shizhi!</p><p>Leng Shizhi was undoubtedly a genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. His expression darkened, and the sound of “Whoosh, whoosh” filled the air. In the face of life and death, his body was covered with a godly armor.</p><p>“Pluff.” The godly armor which Leng Shizhi wore had a great origin, but, against the Invisible Dual Blades, it was still penetrated. The neck of Leng Shizhi became cold; strand by strand, his blood dripped downward. Just a little bit deeper, and his skull would have been separated from his neck!</p><p>If he wasn’t wearing the godly armor, with just these blades, he would have definitely met his end. This time, Leng Shizhi was extremely frightened.</p><p>“Impudence…” Seeing the deteriorating situation, the three sectional leaders yelled in a deafening manner, and they moved at the same time. They took out their Life Treasures and directly went for Li Qiye.</p><p>These three sectional leaders weren’t just lazily sitting around. They were all at the Warrior Canopy and Purified Rebirth ranks.</p><p>“Scram…” In a flash, Li Qiye’s hostility soared with a crimson killing intent. He let out a loud roar, and his Life Wheel appeared along with blood energy that seemed like a sea; with an all-destroying momentum, his blood energy burst forth. This type of domineering and overbearing power even made Li Shuangyan’s expression change.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye lifted his legs and then stomped heavily to jump outside. The most simple technique and the most simple transformation was also the most oppressive move! One kick flew out, and the world was encompassed. The heavens and earth were suppressed, and Gods and Demons were screaming! Just this single heavy kick had the weight of millions of Jun behind it! <a href="#footnote_5">[5]</a></p><p>“Bang… Bang…Bang…” Under this one kick, the three Life Treasures shattered. Life Treasures were just pieces of paper under this one kick of Li Qiye.</p><p>This was Li Shuangyan’s second time seeing such a kick. Her expression greatly changed, and, at this moment, she was certain that Li Qiye was practicing a peerless Immortal Physique!</p><p>The three sectional leaders were frightened until their faces were deathly pale. They immediately shifted their positions, and they were able to escape this horrible kick from Li Qiye.</p><p>The Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique of Li Qiye had the freedom to send and return whenever it wanted, and, even though the three sectional leaders could escape this kick, they still couldn’t escape the Kun Peng’s Six Variants of Li Qiye. While he was pulling back his feet, Li Qiye, like a Kun Peng, flew to the sky; in a flash, he appeared before the three sectional leaders. <a href="#footnote_6">[6]</a></p><p>“Heavenly transformation…” This extreme speed caused the three sectional leaders to be frighteningly amazed. They suddenly recognized the technique, however, it was too late.</p><p>Li Qiye’s kick was like the immortal poison of a scorpion’s stinger. Under the Kun Peng’s Six Variants, this kick was terribly fast. Under the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique, this kick was akin to ten thousand thunders that simultaneously roared together. The three sectional leaders fundamentally couldn’t dodge this kick; it was simply too swift.</p><p><span id="footnote_1" class="footnote">[1] Jumping into the Yellow river – a phrase originating from the belief that people who were indicted wrongfully would commit suicide using this river to prove their innocence.</span></p><p><span class="footnote" id="footnote_2">[2] I actually like master cheating ancestor killing more than the longer line in the last chapter, even though it looks weird in English.</span></p><p><span class="footnote" id="footnote_3">[3] Peng = a giant eagle-like bird, Kun = a giant fish/whale, Kun Peng would be a transformation of both.
