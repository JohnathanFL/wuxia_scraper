Many people couldn’t regain their wits. An Emperor Assailant and one near that level attacked together with the invincible Soaring Immortal Break but not only did they failed, they paid with their lives after just one move from Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The frightening part was how no one saw the killing move. Even an Emperor Assailant like Matriarch Yu and an eonic genius like Gu Zun became serious.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye simply smiled. The four images of the fate palace were beyond the comprehension of many cultivators. Only after becoming emperor would one be able to understand them but it was too late at that point.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A loud blast suddenly made the world tremble. Everyone returned from their contemplation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” Miserable screams came, followed by tearing noises. The azure dragon actually tore the ten winged creature into two pieces.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remember that this creature was created by the Omnidirectional Immortal Annihilation formation. This meant that it was formed by the eight legions with their vitality and flesh.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the creature was tore in half, not only was the formation broken. Even the soldiers were torn into two pieces or crushed by an invincible force.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” After taking care of the formation, the dragon thrust its spear down and pierced the battle platforms. Cracks spanning for thousands of miles appeared everywhere.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the enraged dragon slammed down and made all the platforms crumble. The power within disappeared instantly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat!” The surviving soldiers from Soaring Immortal shouted and ran back to the sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle was finally over. The eight legions from Soaring Immortal still lost against Azure Dragon. They suffered heavy losses with casualty around eighty percent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This might be their biggest loss since the formation of their sect. A five emperors lineage lasting for millions of years had suffered this humiliating defeat.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd wondered about the identity of the Azure Dragon Legion. They were amazed at this legion’s ability to take down eight imperial legions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old man who knew about them commented with a tinge of emotion: “That’s Azure Dragon for you. Back when the Ancient Ming ruled the nine worlds, they have trapped the legion so many times. In the end, the Ancient Ming failed to kill them and was&nbsp;destroyed instead."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who knew about the legion didn’t find this surprising at all. The legion dared to fight against the Ancient Ming. Soaring Immortal wasn’t an issue.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disciples inside Soaring Immortal turned pale. In their mind, their sect was invincible. Not only did they have the most resources in the world, they also had the most powerful legions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these legions were bullied by others today and almost got wiped out completely. They couldn’t imagine this result at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The dragon shattered the entrance to Soaring Immortal, causing the entire place to tremble.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stunned disciples were truly horrified since they have never experienced such a thing before. This also shattered their confidence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get ready.” The ancestors calmed down and ordered the disciples to prepare for combat.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For these ancestors, this will be the darkest day for them. Few dared to oppose their sect in the past but now, someone was actually breaking down their door. This was a perilous moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Majestic laws poured down like the waterfalls from the sceneries in the sect. Layers of defensive barriers were erected. The entire place became dazzling with protection halos.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The place has seemingly turned into the most perfect ancestral ground in the world with so many different defensive means and imperial protection. This made the entire sect look quite divine. No enemy would dare to take a step forward.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the dragon didn’t enter the sect after destroying the entrance. It simply soared upward and presided in the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gigantic dragon with its spear coldly glanced around. Nothing could hide from its gaze.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People were surprised when Azure Dragon didn’t attack Soaring Immortal. They didn’t know why it broke the entrance but didn’t initiate an attack. Instead, it was only guarding the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will the old foes really come out?” Only people like Gu Zun understood the dragon’s intention. He continued: “I really hope so, that’s when the fun really starts.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye stepped inside the entrance and hovered above the sect. All the members in Soaring Immortal weren’t happy to see Li Qiye looking as if he was about to fight all of them alone. Today, the enemy came knocking on their door. This was simply unacceptable.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After so many years, Soaring Immortal grew stronger but its bones became softer. For power, it has abandoned its ancestors.” Li Qiye shook his head and said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li, don’t be so haughty!” A cold voice resounded. It wasn’t loud but it echoed across the world and threatened everyone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four people came out from the sect and filled the world with their divinity and immortal lights. They were quite holy and looked as if they had just come from an immortal world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also an imperial aura to them. Their style and bearing had a noble feel. This imperial temperament wasn’t learned like other experts. After learning imperial techniques, certain experts could use them to replicate the aura of an emperor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these four didn’t need that at all. They had a natural imperial aura to them, not the forceful and stiff ones from techniques.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, their temperament and appearance were innate.

Di Zi can mean child/son, usually son; the author has always referred to them as Di Zi. Di Nu would be a girl, and the author does use that word a bit later in this chapter. Just an issue with translating Chinese to English without context.
