After settling them in, he said: “Stay here for now until I come back.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ego King, where are you going?” Xiaoxiao was curious because his expression was a bit different this time. However, she couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was different.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To meet someone.” Li Qiye smiled and turned to leave.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he made it to the door, he paused for a bit and added: “If I don’t come back, just return from whence you came.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why? I’ll just wait for you to come back.” Xiaoxiao was quite puzzled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Maybe I’ll be dead at that point.” He chuckled and left.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This response stunned the two girls since they didn’t know his intentions. After spending several days together, both of them believed that he wouldn’t die so easily, not even in the competition for the Heaven’s Will.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, their impression of him was that he wasn’t someone so pessimistic. Confidence was ingrained in his nature, and in his eyes, no one could actually kill him. Thus, when he suddenly brought up death out of nowhere, it became quite ominous and confusing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He went deeper into the Divine Tree Ridge at a quickened pace. Of course, he wasn’t there to find anything or to pluck some immortal medicines. His destination was a particular peak.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It pierced the clouds and reached all the way to the firmament. It wasn’t the tallest peak in this place, but it could definitely be ranked among the top ten. He stood there and gazed at the heaven and earth in silence with thoughts rampaging through his mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he has never been afraid of anyone, there were certain things he found difficult to face. At this moment, he was about to face someone that he owes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sun rose and set as he calmly stood there to enjoy the changes in the wind and clouds. It was as if he had turned into a statue.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, several days have passed as he stood there motionlessly. Eventually, at sunrise, a figure descended from the sky. She looked just like an immortal with a peerless bearing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She floated among the bustling wind with the sun and moon as her companions. Anyone would be intoxicated by her magnificent style. The seemingly petrified Li Qiye finally opened his eyes and looked at this woman.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart slightly skipped a beat after seeing her. He carefully stared at her; it looked like the countless years did not leave their mark on her at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the woman chillingly glared at him. There was no hatred or anger, only coldness. He felt a slight pain after seeing this gaze. In the past, this pair of eyes used to be charming and bright just like the stars. Alas, the eyes have become cold all because of him!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a deep breath and said: “I knew you would come. Maybe you have waited a long time for this day.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She maintained her indifferent gaze. In her eyes, it was as if Li Qiye was only a fleeting passenger in her life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know that you hate me.” Li Qiye couldn’t do anything but chuckle: “Which is why I am here to pay the debt. It is time to end this instead of avoiding it like I always have. In the past, I felt that I would still have a chance to apologize, but it is different in this generation since I must go. Maybe I will never come back again…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gently sighed at this point: “This is why we should end it all by giving you an answer. This will be considered completing one of my wishes.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman continued to quietly stare at this stranger in her eyes. Nevertheless, she was still listening to him as if that was all she needed to do.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He calmly met her eyes and smiled: “The years haven't been easy. Maybe you will never forgive me, and I know I am unforgivable on this matter. However, I’ll still need to say goodbye to you in this generation. I don’t mind whatever choice you make, I just know what I need to do, to see you one last time since we might not be able to meet in the future ever again. And yes, I’m very happy and excited to see you at this moment.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was still no response from the distant woman. He only sighed after seeing the lack of response and slowly walked forward to look at her. This made his heart quiver.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long while, he reached out to gently caress her face. It was just as cold as her eyes. She looked like she didn’t care that he was making physical contact.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gently spoke: “If there is an afterlife, I hope to be someone who can stay in one place, the one having to do the waiting. However, in this generation, I have no choice but to keep going straight. I have sworn to never falter and look back. This is who I am, my fate and my true pursuit!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After one last glance, she suddenly turned and drifted towards the horizon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While watching her leave, Li Qiye shouted: “You can think it through and we can end this if you want. I’m afraid this will be the last time I visit Heaven Spirit! I might not come back after this final farewell.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She halted for a second but still chose to leave in the end.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sighed again with disappointment because he understood that she still hasn’t forgiven him. It was indeed his fault back then.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The moon is sometimes round and sometimes a crescent, who can be perfect in this world?” He murmured: “Immortal Emperors and the dark hand behind the curtains, they are still helpless at times, things will not always go their way. Invincible in the nine heavens they might be, but some things are still unsurpassable!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So many people wish for power, wish to become emperors.” He wryly smiled while staring at the sky: “But one day, even the strongest will start to think about how amazing it is to be a mortal. Their lives might be short, but at least they will still have a home at the end of the day!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A tinge of bitterness ran across his face. Even top existences like them had too many ambitions and responsibilities. Power wasn’t omnipotent at times.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world stood still. He finally heaved one last sigh before leaving.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in the inn, both Xiaoxiao and Yujian were looking outside, especially Xiaoxiao. She anxiously paced back and forth with a worried expression. Li Qiye still hasn’t come back after several days. She even wanted to go out and look for him, but Yujian held her back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was ecstatic to see Li Qiye return and immediately jumped into his chest. The corners of her eyes and eyelashes were inadvertently teary even though she wasn’t crying.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye grabbed her face and noticed her tears before smiling: “Little girl, what is there to cry about? Am I not fine right now?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, I know an evil demon like you wouldn’t die so easily.” Xiaoxiao stopped crying and smiled: “Just like the old adage, a good person doesn’t live long while a villain lives for a thousand years. Someone as evil as you will probably live for millions of years.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t help but smile while wiping her tears away. Yujian also smiled after seeing his safe return. As an assassin, her heart has turned cold like her blade. However, she was still quite anxious after he left, especially after hearing his final words. Her hanging heart was finally put down after seeing this; she felt an indescribable happiness.</span></p>
