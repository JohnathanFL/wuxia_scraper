Like you said, I am your husband, so do you think I will plot against you? I can do whatever I want already.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bah! Bah!” Xiaoxiao spoke with disdain: “Don’t daydream so much, who would want to marry you? Please, I don’t like you at all. I’m only doing this to make Jianshi and the others mad. Hmph, trying to steal my man? Don’t even think about it.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite her tender age, this little girl had a fiery temper and would dare to back her words up in a lawless manner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s good, that’s good. I’m really lucky that we aren’t married.” Li Qiye acted completely relieved while patting his chest: “I would be incredibly miserable if you kept on crying and begging. Aizz, look at you, no figure at all and no hint of gentleness. As for the allure of a woman... where? If I marry such a deficient girl, the remaining half of my life would be very sad.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, he intentionally looked her up and down before clicking his tongue as if saying that her figure wasn’t worth a single coin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was aware that he was deliberately teasing her, but her temper couldn’t let this go. She rushed over and arched her slightly visible cleavage while glaring at him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, tell me, what’s wrong with me? Please, I am the prettiest girl in the Jade Sea and loved by the people. Even flowers bloom at my sight…” She was speaking while poking his chest. Her hot temperament was made clear as day from the first glance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth was that Ye Xiaoxiao was indeed very pretty. Even though calling her the number one beauty in the Jade Sea might be an exaggeration, she still grew up quite well with a pair of clear, moist eyes and a flawless nose. Her young age didn’t prevent a valley forming between her breasts. No matter how one looked at it, she was an incredible looker and enough to be praised as kingdom-toppling even if she wasn’t going to be the most beautiful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t mind her outburst and rubbed his chin while quipping: “I’m a person who likes girls with big breasts. Of course, a gentle nature is a win as well.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Freak! Pervert! Watch how I’ll deal with you to rid the world of your evil!” The livid girl turned red and unleashed a barrage of punches and kicks at him. She detested hearing people talk about her modest chest the most.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, little girl, I’m just playing with you.” Li Qiye smiled and stopped her while shaking his head: “Why did you come here?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why should I tell you?” She gave him an annoyed side-glance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nevermind, I don’t want to know anyway.” Li Qiye shrugged with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll make sure you know then.” She wanted to go against him: “I was on the way to the Dragon Demon Sea, but just a bunch of sea monsters aren’t fun at all so Godhalt seemed better. Sure enough, I found that there are many interesting things here.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye joked: “Are you sure you didn’t get lost and run to the wrong place?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her fair face suddenly revealed the truth as she angrily exclaimed: “Bah! You’re the one who’s lost!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye guessed correctly. Xiaoxiao heard that the Bonesea was very lively, so she initially ran there to play. Alas, she didn’t expect to enter the wrong coordinates into the portal so she was directly teleported to Godhalt.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t seem to mind going to the wrong place and decided to have her fun on this continent by robbing people. Many cultivators fell victim to her, especially the disciples from the Spirit Abyss.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at him and asked: “Ey, why are you here? Didn’t you go show off at the Dragon Demon Sea? I heard you were being accompanied by beauties all day long, why willingly run to Godhalt, a place where even birds don’t want to lay eggs at?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Jealous?” He leisurely looked at her and grinned.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She retorted with contempt: “Bah! Stop being so narcissistic all the time, who would be jealous of you!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having grown accustomed to her fiery temper, he continued to smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ey, out with it already, why are you here? Is a treasure about to appear at Godhalt? I heard there were some at the Bonesea too, did you obtain any?” She unleashed a barrage of questions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First of all, my name is not ‘ey’. Second of all, I don’t know if treasures are coming out or not.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She glared at him in response: “Hmph, if your name is not ‘ey’, what should I call you then?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed and replied: “I suppose I don’t mind you calling me husband since I’ve been dabbling in romance recently. Letting you have this honor is still acceptable.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bah, have you no shame?” She stomped on his foot before changing her mood right away with a coquettish blink: “I won’t call you ‘ey’ from now on. You will be Ego King instead since all you do is act all domineering and narcissistic.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled. He didn’t mind what Xiaoxiao addressed him with since he only wanted to tease her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked into the distance and asked: “Is Godhalt fun?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, there’s so much fun going on here.” Her eyes twinkled as she spoke with some excitement and a hint of mystery: “It was lucky that I didn’t go to the Bonesea, I would’ve missed out on many interesting things.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You find it particularly fun because you aren’t being suppressed.” He commented with a smile after noticing her expressive demeanor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do you know!” She was shaken and looked at him in astonishment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You found yourself just fine so you chose to go crazy and rob people in order to have some fun. In your mind, you can even defeat a Godking in Godhalt. How does it feel being the king of bandits?” He amusingly stared at the startled girl.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at him up and down before skeptically asking: “You weren’t spying on me, right?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, she was very puzzled the moment she arrived here. Everyone said that outsiders would be suppressed on this continent, but she was completely untouched. Moreover, she was even able to summon extremely magical and powerful trees that she couldn’t in the past!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After discovering this secret, Xiaoxiao grew quite excited and stayed behind to be a robber since she felt that no one here could be stronger than her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could easily capture a God-Monarch alive before emptying them completely. Just like that, she became addicted to this lifestyle and didn’t even spare the disciples from the Spirit Abyss.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little girl, you are being too paranoid, why would I need to spy on you?” Li Qiye pinched her pink cheeks and smiled: “I could calculate a trivial matter like this with a single glance.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Calculate? This is something that relates to my bloodline and you know about it for sure, that’s why you were able to figure this out.” She gave him a nasty look.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smirked at the girl without answering. However, he agreed in his mind. This was indeed related to her bloodline that contained a great secret.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She stared at him and fiercely demanded: “Come on, what is my bloodline!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, her bloodline had always been a mystery. The Golden Isle had two treefathers, so they understood their race very well. Alas, even the most knowledgeable ancestors failed to figure out her bloodline.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye leisurely smiled and said: “You really want to know? Fine, follow me and be obedient, then you can find out.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bah! You’re trying to trick me, aren’t you? I won’t fall for it.” She snorted and gave him the side-eye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye swung his sleeve: “There’s nothing I can do if you think that way, but if you believe me, I will bring you to a secret location at the Divine Tree Ridge. There, you might be able to comprehend the mysteries of your bloodline to its full extent.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She remained skeptical: “Really?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He replied: “Do I need to lie to you? Remember, I could have taken you in back at the Golden Isle and your father would have been more than happy about the marriage.”</span></p>
