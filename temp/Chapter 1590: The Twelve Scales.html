In short, she placed it in Discover right after. From then on, people called it the “twelve scales” and it became a beautiful scenery in this place.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the Yu Clan didn’t place any restriction, anyone could come and try to climb it. It was a test of comprehension, determination, and dao heart. Cultivators were more than happy to try at least once, especially the younger ones. If they could climb up high, they would gain fame and reputation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some even considered it to be an examination mountain.

Of course, some didn’t care for this test either.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each day, many experts would come to watch or try to climb. The younger ones were much more eager since they wanted to prove their worth!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-1ade"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were even more people here than normal, resulting in a lively and young crowd. The reason was very simple - the golden daughter of the Yu Clan, Yu Yulian wanted to try.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-1ade">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths came to cheer her up. Moreover, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Matriarch Yu</span> had come out so many older experts came to Discover as well. Their juniors followed along. This was a good chance for them to befriend her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People were everywhere around the scales.

Each step was at least three meters high so it wasn’t easy to go up at all. Cultivation didn’t matter here because the entire mountain was created from the shackles of the grand dao. Only an Immortal Emperor who has broken through these chains would be freed from suppression. Otherwise, cultivation was useless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because the higher the cultivation, the greater the pressure from the dao shackle. It wouldn’t help the ascension at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each step had its own note. Others wouldn’t be able to hear anything, only the climbers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This note was the sound of the grand dao.

With that, they would have a much easier time climbing the steps.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it was fine to be average talent-wise. With enough determination and a firm dao heart, they could still withstand the dao note.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sound became increasingly more powerful at the higher steps. It would resonate with the climber’s own grand dao and create a proportional pressure. Thus, the steps were a great challenge to all of the characteristics required for cultivation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one could reach the eighth step, it meant that they were dragons and phoenixes among men. Above this step, they could leave behind a shadow. This was a record of their achievement and glory.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, one could see many shadows on these upper steps.

Once successfully reaching this particular height, they would have made it and be considered a genius.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, a man must leave a long-lasting legacy. Because of this, the young ones wanted to leave behind their shadow on these steps in order to become famous.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eighth step had many shadows of all forms and ages.

It was a supreme figure that was quite young.

Despite being very fuzzy, this shadow has carved itself on the twelfth step.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people stared at these steps enviously. There weren’t that many shadows after the ninth step. However, there were some in the middle of the ninth and tenth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made the crowd curious.
