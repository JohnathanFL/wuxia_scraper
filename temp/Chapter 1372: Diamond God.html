Of course, this is predicated on the chance that you can live until that day.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Guojian quivered from rage as he retorted: “Little animal, if it wasn’t for the godking wanting your life, I would kill you right now!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ignorant child, come already!” Resplendent, standing by the shore, was losing his patience.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Coming, coming. Since you are this anxious to go reincarnate, I’ll help you out.” Li Qiye remained seated on the deck with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” At this time, he opened his fate palace and an ocean of blood came out. It looked just like a majestic kingdom. One couldn’t see the end in sight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a giant vein running through this bloody sea. It looked quite archaic just like an ancestral vein in the earth. Its essence seemed to be inexhaustible and was fueling this kingdom of blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky above the vein, twelve large floating figures could be seen. They were being gestated by the entire sea’s blood energy and the monstrous vein’s essence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kingdom had an amazing origin. Its blood energy was wondrous and vast like a true ocean. Moreover, it had an ancient air like that of a god or an Immortal Emperor. In fact, his kingdom of blood had a purity that exceeded even the existences listed above.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had swallowed all of the ancient blood inside the blood pond as well as the Blood-devil’s kingdom of blood. After doing so, he had been refining it inside his palace to make it his own. He referenced the Blood-devil’s kingdom in this particular task.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the giant vein, it was originally under the Tiger Howl School with the name “Terra’s Root.” He eventually turned it into an ancestral vein before transplanting it into his kingdom of blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He spent a great amount of blood energy and worldly essence from the ancestral vein to create this great kingdom to cultivate twelve gods and devils.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were enormous and floated above the vein. There were six gods and six devils with varying appearances.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” One god came out of the kingdom.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With its first step, a golden light stretched out for millions of miles. Its body exuded a buddhist aura just like a supreme Buddha. However, despite its surging brilliance, it actually looked exactly like Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If there was something different, it would be the body. Its cold shimmer and tough outlook made it seem to be made from a golden metal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is that thing?!” The crowd was stunned to see this deity that resembled Li Qiye. Even the two girls found it surprising. They didn’t expect for him to have something like this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are the Resplendent Godking, so you can play with my Diamond God.” The deity opened its mouth that let out Li Qiye ‘s voice and laughter.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The Diamond God stepped onto the shore and unleashed a fist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come then!” Resplendent didn’t know what this was, but he roared in the face of the incoming diamond first. He decided to directly retaliate with his heavenly fist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The Diamond God met this blow head on. It was unharmed while Resplendent took several steps back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Resplendent roared after seeing this and took out a spear. The sky was suddenly filled with stars. With a loud bang, he thrust the spear towards the Diamond God. It reached forward and only aimed for the Diamond God’s vitals.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clang! Clank! Clank!” Sounds of metal clashing resounded alongside sputtering sparks. Resplendent had stabbed the Diamond God several thousand times. Each thrust could pierce a mountain completely. Not even a Godking would be able to withstand this kind of barrage with their physical body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these thrusts were completely useless before the Diamond God. They only left a yellow, shallow mark at best!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Resplendent was immediately shaken after seeing this. He was full of confidence regarding his abilities, but all of his attacks were nullified.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Too weak, you are only scratching my itch.” The Diamond God opened its mouth and Li Qiye’s laughter came out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Before Resplendent could regain his cool, the Diamond God attacked with two punches that went straight for his chest.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clang! Clank! Clank!” More sparks ignited like gorgeous fireworks in the night sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Diamond God launched an insane barrage of attacks as if it didn’t care for defense. It purposely let Resplendent thrust his spear at its body so that it could slam its fists into his chest. This suicidal tactic left Resplendent at a great disadvantage, so he had to retreat continuously.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t because Resplendent was weaker. In fact, he was much stronger in terms of raw power. The issue was that this Diamond God was completely impervious. Even if Resplendent’s spear was stronger, it still wouldn’t be able to hurt it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He became both angry and alarmed. This spear was his true fate weapon. As a Godking’s spear, its power was unimaginable. Another Heavenly Godking wouldn’t dare to block it with their body. Alas, this Diamond ignored his devastating attacks that could only leave little marks on its body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What the hell is this thing?!” Many people were astounded to see this creation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old paragon speculated: “Could it be a double?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After cultivators reach a certain level, they would be able to cultivate an avatar. However, the power of this body double could only reach around twenty percent of the real body. Moreover, its creation required a great amount of energy and effort.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, this avatar required the blood energy of the original cultivator in order to function. Thus, the battle efficiency of these avatars was not worth the loss in blood energy, so no one truly wanted to cultivate them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t tell me this particular avatar has cultivated the Indestructible Diamond Physique? Plus, it only has twenty percent of the strength of its master. Doesn’t that mean Li Qiye’s power is on the same level as Meng Zhentian?” Someone murmured with uncertainty after seeing this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone felt that this explanation wasn’t very reliable because if this avatar cultivated the diamond physique, it must mean that Li Qiye cultivated it as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This looks to be the limit of your cultivations. Let’s end this here then.” At this time, Puresun, who was fighting against both the Extreme Yang Monarch and Daoist Lin, grew distracted and smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although both of them had been fighting against Puresun, Puresun fought bare-handed from start to finish. All of their attacks were easily repelled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disparity in strength between the two sides was too great. Their combined effort was far from being Puresun’s match.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” Puresun’s Ancient Purity Blade issued a hymn. Puresun held it in his hand without removing the sheath and casually swept it horizontally like a dragon crossing the sky.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang!” The scabbard swept through both the monarch and Daoist Lin. The two were blown away and fell to the ground while spraying out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The daoist politely smiled and said: “Good duel, thanks for going easy on me.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Extreme Yang Monarch and Daoist Lin stood up, pale and distraught. Their combined effort failed to withstand a single move from the daoist. At this moment, they finally understood that the daoist was already a Godking. The difference in power was too large. They no longer had the face to continue to stay here, so they turned and quickly disappeared into the horizon.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked to see this, even Cao Guojian who was a character of the Godking level. No one thought that the daoist was powerful to this level. Two geniuses were nothing before him! This revealed that he was already a Godking. A Godking this young was a frightening matter. Everyone would feel a bit scared after thinking about it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two ants actually dared to contend against my brother.” Profound murmured with disdain after seeing the two run away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had expected this outcome, but his brother was too benevolent. If it was him, he would have made mincemeat out of those two already!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People finally took a deep breath to calm down. They understood why the arrogant and powerful Profound Monarch acted so respectfully towards this unknown daoist. It wasn’t only because of seniority, it was because Puresun’s strength was deserving of respect!</span></p>
