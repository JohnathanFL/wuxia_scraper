I won’t reveal it and you won’t either but you know that I am a fake.” Li Qiye chuckled.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an implicit understanding of sorts between the two to keep this a secret.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But it is Brother Li at this moment.” Jianshi smiled back: “You know that I didn’t force you at all. You agreed to this.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true.” Li Qiye replied: “Let us go back to the topic of your brother-in-law. Though your lil sis is tight-lipped about this matter and probably never told you, you probably have guessed it being her brother and all.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not all-knowing. I don't know if Lurui doesn’t tell me.” He shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed in response: “Your little trick is of no use in front of me. Even if your sister doesn’t tell you, you know the father of that child!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I also want to know but there’s no place to start.” Jianshi firmly denied.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To which Li Qiye laughed: “Is that so? I know that you know after seeing your expression towards Huaiyu. You don’t mind the&nbsp;child at all and even like her a little.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a bit before continuing: “Just think about it, a man suddenly breaking the marriage alliance between your two clans and even had a daughter with your sister. This is a big scandal and as the future clan master, you wouldn’t want something like this to happen at all. Say, you love your sister so you can accept her mistake, I can understand this. However, from the perspective of the future clan master, you will not be able to accept a bastard into your clan even if you love your sister! But surprisingly enough, you adore the little girl and could accept her without any difficulty. What does this mean?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled mysteriously and stared at Jianshi: “it means that you can accept her identity and bloodline. On a deeper level, it shows that you know who her father is but it even goes further than that, you must have had a deep relationship with him! If it wasn’t for this marriage alliance, perhaps you would have been happy to have him as a brother-in-law!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi was shocked after hearing this and staggered backward with waves surging in his mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though his sister really didn’t reveal the father, they grew up together so when he saw Huaiyu, he immediately guessed everything, including the identity of the father.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Li Qiye has said, a bastard child shouldn’t appear in the Wenren Clan. However, he didn’t mind at all and could accept her. One could even say that he was very excited to see his niece and was ready to assume the responsibility of being an uncle.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite his guess, he didn’t tell anyone, not even his father because he didn’t wish to besmirch the reputation of a hero. After all, he made illustrious contributions and gave up his life for the Wenren Clan!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought that no one would know this matter outside of Lurui herself. Who would have thought that Li Qiye would know everything? There was an impulse manifesting in his eyes. He didn’t want this news to spread.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t bother thinking about it. It should be clear that I’m not afraid of anyone since I am sitting right here without any stress.” Li Qiye leisurely smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi took a deep breath and smile: “Brother Li, you’re overthinking it. It would be good if I were to know but it doesn’t matter right now since you are my brother-in-law.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t deny it.” Li Qiye said with a smile.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Dongfang people will come soon. I think you’ll be departing tomorrow so take care then.” Jianshi said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s no problem, I can handle taking the blame. However, you need to tell your father that if he wants me to be a scapegoat, Huaiyu must stay in my sight. If I am her father, I shall have the final say in her fate!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Li, I’m afraid I can’t do that but I can assure you that she’ll be safe.” Jianshi considered for a moment before shaking his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You missed my point.” Li Qiye said flatly: “I’m not negotiating with you or your clan. You only have one choice and that is to follow my wish.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His aggressiveness changed Jianshi’s expression!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Li, that was too arrogant just now.” Jianshi took a deep breath and said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled back: “What do you think? Do as I say and take her along. I don’t want to let the child see too much blood, understand?!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi’s demeanor changed rapidly several times in a short period. Though their clan wouldn’t be intimidated so easily, but Li Qiye was here alone and completely at ease. He couldn’t tell what the guy was capable of.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll tell them about your request.” Jianshi made up his mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, Li Qiye was taken to the Dongfang Clan on the second day.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the Wenren Clan had no choice. The moment they took Lurui back, the Dongfang Clan has gotten wind of this as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the Dongfang needed the Wenren to hand someone over. As in-laws, they might not do anything to Wenren Lurui but an outsider like Li Qiye seducing their bride? There was no chance for forgiveness.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both clans wanted to deal with this in a low-key manner. The Dongfang clan found out very quickly so the Wenren Clan had to hand Li Qiye over.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the Wenren Clan Master had no control over this matter. They could only hope Li Qiye would shoulder the blame, then they could deal with it quietly and defuse the misunderstandings.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many people waiting outside when Li Qiye was escorted out. Outside of Jianshi and his father, a bunch of experts from the clan was responsible for him too.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, there were several old men from the Dongfang Clan. They immediately sent out unfriendly gaze at him right away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two experts wanted to take his arms in order to subdue him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t become angry at all and repeated the same phrase with a smile: “You want to keep your dog hands?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave it.” Jianshi ordered. He knew that Li Qiye wouldn’t run away at this moment. He would have done so long ago if there was any intention of escaping.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A carriage slowly came about with Wenren Lurui inside. She was silent with a haggard complexion since she didn’t know what fate was awaiting her at the Dongfang Clan.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing she was worried about the most was not herself but her daughter, Wenren Huaiyu. Alas, she alone couldn’t protect her daughter.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The carriage was in front under the escort of the Wenren Clan’s experts.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Li, it’s time to hit the road.” Jianshi politely told Li Qiye. He even deliberately let Li Qiye stay close to Huaiyu.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His intention was obvious. If the Wenren Clan has agreed to Li Qiye’s condition, he must also not go back on his words and shoulder the blame.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, I also want to take a trip.” He smiled and said: “Let’s go fast, I have to leave after dealing with this trivial business.” With that, he trotted forward.</span></p>
