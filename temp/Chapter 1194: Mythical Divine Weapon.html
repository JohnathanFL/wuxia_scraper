<p><b>Chapter 1194: Mythical Divine Weapon</b></p><p>She eventually composed herself and looked at Li Qiye to say: “Perhaps you are interested in the great maelstrom. We may be of assistance in this respect.”</p><p>After hearing this, Li Qiye opened his eyes wide. A glint shot out from within while he stared at her intensely.</p><p>She didn’t know why, but the glint that flashed from his eyes frightened her in an indescribable manner. She felt like an ancient beast was awakening.</p><p>However, she met his gaze head-on for a long time without fear because she had no malicious intent in the first place.</p><p>“It seems like you have seen a few things.” Li Qiye slowly said, still fixated on her.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare to hide it from you. I was at the Abyss Sea that day, but it was still quite far away from the maelstrom. I only caught a glance.” She nonchalantly said: “However, I didn’t expect this coincidence, for you to have an imperial bloodline. Perhaps this is a type of fate.”</p><p>“Fate...” Li Qiye only smiled and closed his eyes without caring too much.</p><p>“If you wish to venture into the maelstrom in the future, our three schools can help you. After all, we are part of the ancient Charming Spirit Race, we have things other lineages lack.”</p><p>Li Qiye laughed while looking at her: “Little Beauty!”</p><p>She couldn’t help but ask: “Young Noble, why are you laughing? If I have said something wrong, please point it out.” She was negotiating with great sincerity.</p><p>“You have no idea.” Li Qiye shook his head and replied: “You think that I am trying to go into the maelstrom, but the truth is that I want nothing from it.”</p><p>He had already obtained the Life Origination he wanted and didn’t care about the other things in there. Even if it had a few heaven-shattering secrets and incredible treasures, they still had nothing to do with him. Others were free to covet these treasures all they want.</p><p>Zhuo Jianshi found this surprising. On that day, she saw him entering the maelstrom, so she thought he had some ideas about it.</p><p>“You are mistaken about this matter, the maelstrom is meaningless to me. On the other hand, you charming spirits should pay more attention to it.”</p><p>She shuddered internally and immediately asked: “What do you mean?”</p><p>Li Qiye slightly raised his brow: “Don’t play this mind game in front of me or I’ll rip off your clothes. If you are one of the schoolmasters from Void Imperfection, you should know a little about this.”</p><p>Her heart sank a bit. Of course, it was not because of Li Qiye’s threat of tearing off her clothes, it was because she had heard some legends before. There were records within the sect, but they were too vague for her to learn anything substantial.</p><p>She sincerely asked while looking at him: “I am not trying to conceal anything. The records left behind are only legends, making it quite difficult to tell whether they are accurate or not. Since you dared to enter the maelstrom, I’m sure you know more. Would you be willing to enlighten me?”</p><p>He looked at her for a moment before answering: “Even if I say more, you won’t necessarily be able to distinguish its validity. I can only say that if one day something actually happens to the maelstrom, it will be a catastrophe for the entire Heaven Spirit World, especially for charming spirits!”</p><p>She curiously asked: “What kind of catastrophe?”</p><p>“That depends on the things in there. One accident will bring about a disaster, so when that day comes, run for your life, flee from the Heaven Spirit World. The farther the better.” He smiled and added: “Of course, that day might also never come.”</p><p>She quietly contemplated after hearing this. The maelstrom had always been a mystery, but ever since a very distant era the charming spirits had been wary of it.</p><p>“Is it true that there are supreme items within the maelstrom?” She had to ask the question that was lingering in her mind because there were too many different versions of this legend.</p><p>“Yes, truly supreme treasures.” He answered: “But it also depends on what you have in mind. If you are thinking about weapons, then yes, they are indeed there.”</p><p>“How do we obtain those weapons then?” She couldn’t help but ask: “How do they compare to the sea demon’s Trident?”</p><p>Li Qiye laughed and said: “Do you know the origin of the Trident? Or of its true power?”</p><p>She answered: “It is the supreme divine artifact of the sea demons. Those who are accepted by the Trident can become the Sea God. Its power is boundless and invincible in myriad realms and even more formidable than an Immortal Emperor True Treasure.”</p><p>Sea demons were similar to treants. Their strongest existences were not Immortal Emperors; their equivalent to treefathers were called Sea Gods.</p><p>However, these unrivaled existences must be recognized by the Trident. After meeting this requirement, they would become a Sea God capable of wielding the artifact.</p><p>Historically, these supremes of the sea demons wielding the Trident could put up a good fight against an Immortal Emperor with a true treasure!</p><p>“What you know is only superficial drizzle, but there’s no need to elaborate on this. Even if there are divine weapons comparable to the Trident in there, who among your race can wield such artifacts?”</p><p>With that, he finished: “Charming spirits should continue to pursue the path towards Immortal Emperor. This is the correct way. The others are only alternative methods for when there is no other choice.”</p><p>Having said that, he closed his eyes again and gently waved his sleeve: “Okay, now don’t bother me again.”</p><p>Zhuo Jianshi sighed and stood up then bowed: “Our doors will always be open to you. Come visit us anytime.”</p><p>Li Qiye seemed to have fallen asleep at this moment; it was impossible to know if he actually heard her or not.</p><p>She stopped bothering him and gently rode the waves away before disappearing completely. She was not offended by this meeting and only felt disappointment instead. This trip was essentially meaningless; in the end, she understood that her schools didn’t interest him at all.</p><p>Li Qiye was still lying quietly on the sea and drifted with the flow. This process continued for a while. Eventually, he suddenly opened his eyes and drilled into the sea. A moment later, a huge trench appeared before him.</p><p>This was a small part of the Bottomless Trench distant from the previous sea region.</p><p>Li Qiye entered the trench in one go. In this split second, he released his divine intent to sweep through this area. Nothing could escape from his sense.</p><p>Eventually, he stood before a particular cliff inside the trench. There was a depression with a clam the size of a basin that occasionally spat out bubbles.</p><p>It looked quite ordinary. The only thing worth noticing was the pearl within it, emitting a faint light.</p><p>Li Qiye smiled upon the sight of the clam and the pearl: “It really isn’t easy to find this pathfinder clam. Only by following the current of the ocean would one be able to eventually find this clam and the correct path.”</p><p>Li Qiye was drifting with the sea in order to catch this type of clam.</p><p>Of course, there were countless clams in the Jade Sea and the Bottomless Trench. One could find as many as they wanted. However, very few clams were capable of pathfinding.</p><p>In the past, he had searched and caught many clams before finally learning the mysteries within and understanding their usage. With the successful capture, he identified the correct direction and headed back to Shallow Beach.</p><p>His trip here was to find two things in order to replenish the life of the Peacock Tree. One of them was the Void Imperfection Spring inside the ancestral whale while the other was hidden in another secret location.</p><p>This was precisely why he needed this pathfinder clam; he needed it to find the second well-concealed item since a thoughtless search would yield no results.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
