All had a firm dao heart after reaching this level. Instilling fear in them was no easy task.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were concerned that under their spatial suppression, no one should be able to escape, at least in theory. However, Li Qiye clearly turned invisible and hid from their gazes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cryptic Space was too amazing. Once Li Qiye used it as an emperor, other emperors at the same level wouldn’t be able to find him so easily. It also meant that he could escape right before their eyes to the tenth world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strange enough, he had no intention of escaping. It looked as if he wanted to fight them. This meant that he was completely confident in fighting against thirteen emperors. This made them nervous.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">World Emperor stared intensely at him. He understood the Dark Crow quite well after contending against him for generations. This guy wouldn’t participate in any battle he wasn’t certain of victory.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he had no reinforcement coming but there was a clear path for retreat yet he still chose to stay here. This was the most terrifying thing, a reason for World Emperor to be perturbed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps he wasn’t lying before about needing assistance from other Immortal Emperors. Maybe even if they didn’t hide the coordinates, no emperors would come either since Li Qiye was confident in going against them alone!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to see your Heaven’s Wills.” World Emperor said. He was the strongest supporting force so he wouldn’t be the first one to take action.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Geezer,&nbsp;it looks like you’re not confident at all. Who do you think will win this chess game? You still think you’re one of the players?” Li Qiye laughed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">World Emperor wanted to see Li Qiye’s Heaven’s Wills since he hasn’t shown it all this time. He was certain that Li Qiye had become an emperor with a will but so far, the guy had only relied on his four physiques to stop them. The Dark Crow was one of the few people in this world who could make a twelve-wills emperor worried.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Still want to fight?” Li Qiye taunted the emperors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, Grand Emperors never run from a fight.” Dao Dragon Heaven Emperor still had a smile on his face.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His dao heart remained steady despite being obliterated just now by Li Qiye. He didn’t look down on himself and this was not a blind confidence either. The guy remained vigilant, ready to come up with a new plan.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These emperors would never run away due to fear. At most, they would resort to a roundabout fighting method, such as switching in and out in order to tire the enemy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, running could be a viable strategy as well. Ordinary cultivators would run away against a stronger opponent due to fear. These emperors would run because it was the best possible plan.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Crow, go ahead and use your killing moves. We’re ready.” World Emperor solemnly declared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Until Li Qiye revealed his Heaven’s Wills, World Emperor wouldn’t be able to predict Li Qiye’s real ace cards and overall strength. This was one of his best abilities after reaching this level.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven’s Will was an emperor’s strongest backing. When it appeared, one would be able to gauge the emperor’s strength. But now, Li Qiye was already contending against them without resorting to the Heaven’s Will. What if he were to release it?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My sweet geezer, where's your confidence? Very well, we've been a family for so long, if I don’t present a grand gift to you in our meeting today, I would be a useless son-in-law. Behold, my grand gift. I hope you are ready to show something else that can stop me!” Li Qiye continued his teasing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">World Emperor has grown used to Li Qiye’s style.

A total of thirteen floated above Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thirteen palaces!” The twelve weaker Grand Emperors took a deep breath.

However, they were still astonished to see the number of fate palaces because it was completely unprecedented. No one in the tenth world had thirteen palaces either.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency, you have completely surpassed us and created a new path.” Dao Dragon Heaven Emperor spoke with admiration.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The combatants at this level would normally respect their foes. Li Qiye’s creating thirteen palaces has earned their respect. All the other emperors beside Dao Dragon felt the same way.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a miracle for the ages.

This was the existing concept for the emperors in the tenth world. Even though Li Qiye came from the nine worlds, he had broken the eternal shackles. Who knows what will happen in the future? Perhaps he would be able to shoulder thirteen Heaven’s Wills.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such an existence had never appeared in the tenth world.

I thought about using Purity for this title, but if he uses tree/wood/nature techniques, then it wouldn’t be as accurate. The character for wood can mean simple as well, and from simple I get pure, so its two characters for pure, hence purity.
