<p><b>Chapter 1189: Ye Tu</b></p><p>A little courtyard was located in this trench. The seawater steered clear from it, revealing old green tiles. One glance was enough to tell that this little home had been built a long time ago.</p><p>Li Qiye went inside to find a young man lazily basking in the sun. He looked a little over twenty, but despite his young age, he had an aura of sophistication and maturity.</p><p>The young man immediately stood up when Li Qiye approached. He cupped his fists and smiled: “May I ask what you are here for, Sir?”</p><p>Li Qiye looked him up and down before speaking: “You are a disciple of the Void Imperfection School, correct?”</p><p>The youth answered right away: “Yes, my name is Ye Tu from the Charming Spirit Race, the Void Imperfection supervisor of the Shallow Beach Branch.”</p><p>Li Qiye insipidly revealed: “I know, charming spirits make up the majority at the three schools and have been in control for generations. The demon boss at the inn is an exception, a disciple like that is quite rare in your sect.”</p><p>“Ah.” Ye Tu smiled and said: “Sir, you must be talking about my senior uncle. He likes to play around.”</p><p>He looked at the youth and declared: “I want to visit the Void Imperfection School. It is good that you are the supervisor here, let me in so I won’t have to barge in myself.”</p><p>Ye Tu scratched his head in response: “May I ask for your name, Sir?”</p><p>“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye calmly answered: “There’s no need to tell you my race, right?”</p><p>“Li Qiye…” When Ye Tu heard this name, he was shocked to the point where he almost jumped. He took a careful look at Li Qiye.</p><p>“Are you wondering why I don’t have the aura of an imperial bloodline?” Li Qiye nonchalantly spoke after noticing the youth’s reaction.</p><p>“Well…” Ye Tu rubbed his palms and coughed before smiling: “I wouldn’t dare. It is just that my vision is lacking and can’t see through Brother Li at all.”</p><p>“Your choice of words isn’t bad.” Li Qiye smiled: “Did Golden Isle inform your schools?”</p><p>“We received their message not long ago.” The youth replied: “I heard Brother Li had left Golden Isle, so the elders there asked our Charming Spirit Race to keep an eye out and help you if necessary.”</p><p>The Void Imperfection Three Schools were lineages of charming spirits while Golden Isle was a treant lineage. Logically speaking, Golden Isle should have informed the treants first.</p><p>There was a reason why Golden Isle did it this way. It was because the charming spirits were even more eager than them to marry humans with noble bloodlines. In fact, they married more humans than the sea demons and treants added together.</p><p>“As their groom?” Li Qiye laughed. He understood their hidden intentions.</p><p>“Ah, I heard you haven’t married the golden daughter from the isle yet, correct?” Ye Tu smiled and immediately brought a chair for Li Qiye to sit in.</p><p>Golden Isle informed them in order to let the three schools know that Li Qiye was already their groom and to not compete for this bloodline with them!</p><p>In fact, at the Jade Sea, the behemoths like the three schools had received a lot of information. For example, Li Qiye, with his imperial bloodline, had been kidnapped by someone.</p><p>Li Qiye sat down cooly without any reservation. Meanwhile, Ye Tu was very enthusiastic and showed good hospitality as well.</p><p>“It is our honor to have Brother Li here at Shallow Beach. I represent the beach to thank you for granting us this chance…” Ye Tu quickly poured some tea for Li Qiye, playing his part as a good host.</p><p>Li Qiye smiled after hearing the flattering words. He touched his chin and leisurely mused: “I never thought I had such charm before.”</p><p>“Brother Li is a master the likes of which rarely appears. A meeting with you has to be the blessing of fate. Despite your noble status, you have no hint of arrogance…” The youth smiled.</p><p>Li Qiye took a sip and asked: “So? You want to betroth your senior sister or your junior sister to me?”</p><p>“Er—” Ye Tu had no response to Li Qiye’s directness. After a while, he grinned: “If you are willing to be our guest at the Void Imperfection School, you can have your pick.”</p><p>Li Qiye just smiled and shook his head: “Forget it, don’t make me participate in this ‘noble’ cause. In your minds, I am only a stallion to produce more royal bloodlines for the charming spirits to groom another Immortal Emperor, just like Immortal Emperor Yan Shi.” [1. Yan Shi means peaceful/repose/prosperous/feast era, or a golden age.]</p><p>“Immortal Emperor Yan Shi…” Ye Tu was moved by this name. He murmured: “It would be a great honor if the Void Imperfection Three Schools could have a human Immortal Emperor.”</p><p>Immortal Emperor Yan Shi was the second emperor from Gu Chun’s four branches. Legend states that her father came from the Exquisite Valley. Moreover, she was also a descendant of Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo, thus she had an imperial bloodline running through her veins. [2. Gu Chun = First Immortal Emperor of all races, a charming spirit. Mu Zhuo = Wood Refinement. I’m not sure what the four branches are though, not clear here.]</p><p>Later on, her father married a beauty with a pure bloodline from Gu Chun’s four branches. In the end, they gave birth to a daughter, the unfathomable Immortal Emperor Yan Shi. [3. Remember that only Hong Tian has Empress in her title. Keeping true to the raw, even female Immortal Emperors have emperor in their title. It works in the narrative this way because the author likes to hide the sex sometimes, if we change it to empress to keep it grammatically correct, it might create some problems with the narrative. This particular issue has popped up several times before.]</p><p>In the minds of the charming spirits, Immortal Emperor Yan Shi’s achievements were incredible. She was someone comparable to their first emperor, Immortal Emperor Gu Chun! Because of this, her title was Yan Shi. It meant that under her reign, the nine worlds would have peace, a golden era!</p><p>Because of this, the charming spirits wanted to marry humans even more than treants and sea demons. They wanted to produce a better bloodline, a second Immortal Emperor Yan Shi in order to bring about prosperity to their race.</p><p>Li Qiye glanced at Ye Tu and said: “Forget about this stallion matter. The beauties here at the Heaven Spirit World and I are not meant to be.” He laughed after making this statement.</p><p>Some people considered being a stallion to be their pride while others deemed it a shameful matter. However, Li Qiye thought nothing about it. Of course, he wouldn’t become any race’s stallion either.</p><p>“Ah, ah, we can take our time talking things through.” Ye Tu smiled in response: “I welcome your presence here at our school very much. If you are willing to stay, I can take you there.”</p><p>Of course Ye Tu wanted Li Qiye to stay. Although the Void Imperfection School was relatively low-key and not famous among the three since they didn’t want to compete with the rest of the world, they also didn’t want to give up someone with a bloodline like Li Qiye’s. Nothing could be better than having this bloodline join their school.</p><p>The enthusiastic youth gave some orders to other disciples before bringing Li Qiye to his school.</p><p>Very few people could enter the Void Imperfection School, only certain talents with some influence were able to. Moreover, not too many knew where the school was located.</p><p>The only thing others knew was that the school’s ancestral ground was not stationary. They were aware that it was built around the sea-territory of the school itself, but the exact location was unknown.</p><p>On the other hand, Li Qiye knew exactly where the school was located. However, he wanted to go there in a friendly manner this time, so he didn't forcefully enter.</p><p>Blue skies along with the blue sea and the occasional wafting clouds painted a scenic view worthy of a poem.</p><p>Ye Tu and Li Qiye stepped onto a white cloud. The scene suddenly changed. A flying continent was before them with rolling mountains and faint valleys. This was a nature-filled place with gurgling streams accompanied by buildings and temples.</p><p>This continent floating in the sky seemed incredibly surreal, just like a painting. People would think that this was a paradise, taking their breath away with its beauty.</p><p>It turned out that the ancestral ground of the Void Imperfection School was hidden among the clouds. This group of clouds traveled around this region of the sea. Because of this, no one knew where the school was actually built.</p><p>Visitors were met with serenity. Many of the ancient buildings with closed doors had been unoccupied for a long time. Even the ones with opened doors seemed to have no signs of people.</p><p>Occasionally on one or two hills, a few disciples could be found sweeping the leaves away from relatively newer temples. Nevertheless, this didn’t break the tranquility of this area.</p><p>Outsiders would be shocked at this scene. With so few disciples, no one would believe that this was the greatest lineage in the Heaven Spirit World!</p><p>In the minds of many, a great lineage should have plenty of talents and geniuses that appeared in waves. As for regular disciples, they should number in the millions.</p><p>“After so many years, your branch is still the same — peaceful and taking things easy. It is remarkable that such an inheritance has continued this way until now.” Li Qiye emotionally murmured while looking at the tranquil mountains and rivers.</p><p>The Void Imperfection School was different from the other two schools. It rarely appeared or let anyone inside. Outside of the three schools themselves, outsiders didn’t know how many disciples it had.</p><p>Ye Tu explained: “Many senior and junior uncles are traveling and training. A few senior brothers and sisters also went outside, leaving only us, the young ones, behind to take care of the trivial matters in the sect.”</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
