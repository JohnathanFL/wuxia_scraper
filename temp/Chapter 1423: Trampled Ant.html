She glanced over at Li Qiye and then back at the elder before revealing a cute smile: “Do you know who he is? This is a famous great character, Li Qiye!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye?” After hearing this, the elder laughed in response: “Your reputation precedes you. The younger generation will surpass us in time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His attitude bore no semblance of admiration, he was clearly mocking him in a dismissive fashion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, this place is Godhalt!” His smile disappeared, only the arrogance remained: “I don’t care if you are Li Qiye or Li Baye, tuck your tail between your legs before our Spirit Abyss for your own sake! Even if you are stronger, a dragon crossing the river, opposing us on our turf will only result in us severing your tendons and breaking your spine until you submit.” <a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the present, very few of those who knew Li Qiye’s deeds would dare to show such an arrogant attitude and utter these overbearing words.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this elder dared to do so. In his eyes, it didn’t matter who the hell came to Godhalt, they better start acting sensibly and obey the rules even if they were the most incredible genius.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a character like Meng Zhentian would have to send tributes and act politely to them while visiting Godhalt. Because of this, he showed no apprehension towards Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The abyss was an uncrowned king in Godhalt, the greatest existence. They wouldn’t be afraid of anyone unless an Immortal Emperor personally came!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How fearless.” Xiaoxiao was astonished at the elder’s confidence: “Watch it or it will bring about sect-destruction!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wasn’t trying to flatter Li Qiye since she believed that he was strong enough to carry it out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect-destruction?!” The elder’s expression turned cold as he uttered: “Who cares if he is an amazing genius? Before becoming emperor, he is nothing but a dog before our abyss…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This retort was powerful enough. It was the same as pointing straight at Li Qiye and criticizing him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With your comment just now, I will consider destroying your Spirit Abyss.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile. In the blink of an eye, a great hand reached for the elder.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, show me just how much strength you have left!” The elder shouted and released his energy without a care before attacking Li Qiye with a monstrous pressure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his mind, Li Qiye was being suppressed by Godhalt right now so he shouldn’t be that strong. He believed that he alone could kill Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Li Qiye’s hand only slightly moved, but it could destroy everything with the Hell Suppressing Fist. The elder’s attack was simply not worth mentioning.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ba!” He easily clasped the elder’s neck.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” The elder was aghast due to this sudden development.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another disciple shouted: “Junior, don’t be presumptuous, release him right now!” Despite the call for a ceasefire, they attacked without holding anything back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mere ants.” Li Qiye laughed and reached out with one finger.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff! Pluff! Pluff!” All of the disciples’ attacks were penetrated. They fell face-up with horrifying holes on their foreheads where blood continued to seep out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re not being suppressed!” The elder was shocked since he realized something at this critical moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct, but there is no prize.” Li Qiye responded with a grin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder’s expression turned extremely ugly right away. Not even in his wildest dreams would he expect for something like this to happen. It was simply impossible. Without the abyss’ help, everyone would be suppressed by Godhalt. Immortal Emperors were exceptions, of course. However, Li Qiye definitely didn’t get any help from the Spirit Abyss yet he was doing just fine — simply inconceivable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what if you’re not suppressed?” The elder regained his composure and coldly uttered: “We are not afraid of anyone at Godhalt. Be smart and hand over the assassin now or you will regret it sooner or later. At that time, it will be too late to beg for forgiveness.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His rampant arrogance was still undeterred despite falling into Li Qiye’s hands. He had absolute confidence in his sect, and if Li Qiye dared to oppose them, he would be killed soon enough should he chose to stay on this continent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye stared at the arrogant elder and revealed a smile: “You know, the Spirit Abyss you are so proud of is nothing more than a nest of ants in my eyes. Even if the ancestor in the deepest location of your sect comes out, he will kneel and wipe my shoes before licking my feet. Actually, your coven of bastards isn’t even qualified to do so.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” The elder nearly vomited blood from anger as his face turned red.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought he was arrogant enough, but Li Qiye viewed them as mere ants or something even inferior to ants! Like Li Qiye said, he wouldn’t want their ancestor to wipe his shoes since he felt that he was unqualified to do so.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, good, good, Li, I’ll see just how long you can be arrogant for. Our Spirit Abyss will make you regret this…” The elder’s fury turned into a crazed laughter.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Crack!” Li Qiye crushed his dao foundation before he could finish.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his foundation crushed, the elder’s blood energy dissipated. He withered away with white hair and a face full of wrinkles. The unreachable elder has fallen. Now, he was as feeble as a candle flickering in the wind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder screamed: “What have you done?!” He was extremely afraid and his wits still hadn’t returned.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivators weren’t afraid of death, but having a destroyed foundation was a life worse than death!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was doubly true for this ancestor. Normally, he would act haughtily towards the great characters that visit Godhalt since they had no choice but to be humble before him. He had grown accustomed to this lifestyle of flattery. But now, with his dao foundation crushed, he was only a cripple inferior to even ordinary mortals — completely defenseless!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Falling down from the pedestal to the ground was a contrast too grim to imagine. He simply couldn’t accept this reality.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye threw him away like trash and flatly said: “I’m sparing your dog life so that you can send a message to the abyss. Tell them to be smart or I’ll destroy all of them! You’re only a bunch of bastards, do not prance around in front of me!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder returned from despair and screamed at Li Qiye: “Li, kill me if you dare! If not, you’re merely a coward!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled at the desperate old man: “I won’t kill you. If you are brave enough, go find a place to hang yourself.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li, you cowardly trash, kill me if you dare!” The elder continued to scream while grabbing onto Li Qiye’s legs with the intention to die.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye casually kicked him away and replied: “Aren’t the people from the abyss always arrogant? Like I said earlier, even your oldest ancestor is nothing before me, he’s only worthy of disdain!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, he ignored the elder and supported Sima Yujian then left. Ye Xiaoxiao kept up with them right away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder desperately screamed while watching the group depart: “You little bastard, you goddamn animal! You don’t dare to kill your grandfather? I’m your grandfather, come kill me if you dare!”&nbsp;<a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted nothing more than for Li Qiye to give him the sweet relief of death. Li Qiye simply ignored him.

Their imperious abyss has no consideration for others, so let them taste despair. They’re only a bunch of monsters that crawled up from the ground, yet they actually think they are the progenitors of the charming spirits, the darlings of the heavens.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao didn’t say anything back.
