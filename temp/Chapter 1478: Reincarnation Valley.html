This particular valley was lush and surrounded by rivers running around the green and rolling mountains.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t overly large and secluded, but it did have an oppressive energy. This land would give birth to wondrous creatures, possibly even a deity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It wasn’t like this the last time I came.” Su Yonghuang was surprised to see this scene even before entering the valley.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled and revealed: “It’s not too surprising since the great momentum hid it before. Right now, you are seeing the true entrance.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this grand momentum?” Yonghuang was puzzled about this matter. Before, due to Li Qiye’s warning, she didn’t dare to venture further and left after finding her ancestor’s remains.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, she still felt this majestic momentum. Once inside, she felt as if she was immersed in a boundless world. Everything became insignificant in comparison.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This momentum has converged around the nine leaves because they have almost matured.” Li Qiye chuckled: “If this wasn’t the case, it would be easier said than done to find this place. Some sea gods have come in person in the past, but they couldn’t do anything because of it. If it wasn’t for the map left behind by Immortal Emperor Bu Si, you wouldn’t have been able to find this place either.” He glanced at her after saying this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She finally understood how precious the map she had was at this moment. Half of this diagram was left by her ancestor while the other was traded from the Minor Zen School. It came from a female disciple of the Undying Gate that married into their sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at the geography ahead: “In the past, the emperor left behind this map as a backup plan. Alas, the gate had fallen and couldn’t make use of it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She asked: “If he knew about this place and have visited it in the past, why didn’t he take the Reincarnation Nine-Leaves away?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gently shook his head: “He didn’t exactly come here for the grass. At the very least, he didn’t want to eat it to enter the reincarnation cycle to live for another generation. Someone at his level wouldn’t bet on such a low chance. Outside of researching the grass, he came for something else, not just to take it away.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a moment before continuing: “Plus, with the grand momentum here, it’s no simple task to take it away. A forceful attempt at taking something away from the power of the ridge would make it wither right away, not to mention that even an emperor would find it difficult to attack this place. Even if they were capable, they might not want to pay the price!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even emperors can’t take it down?” Su Yonghuang was shocked to hear this. During their respective eras, emperors were invincible existences.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye replied: “If one were to attack with wanton regard for the price, they could still succeed. Alas, the price would be unimaginable.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She asked with astonishment: “What kind of place is this then? Do all immortal medicines have this type of grand momentum to protect them?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is undeniable that an immortal medicine of the Reincarnation Nine-Leaves’ level would be protected by the world itself.” Li Qiye gazed at the valley and replied: “However, it is not the case here. To a smaller extent, the momentum is man-made, but due to the location blessed by the high heavens, you can also say that this momentum is a natural phenomenon.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you saying that these leaves have a master or had a master before?” She could read what he was implying.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at her and said: “You are very discerning, truly a good seed to be a disciple.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop trying to insinuate anything and obediently call me master instead.” She gritted her teeth and angrily glared at him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words didn’t carry much confidence because a master like her had no semblance of one while Li Qiye didn’t look like a disciple at all. As the master, she had nothing to teach him, but he instead had taught her many things. Their roles were completely reversed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and said: “You are right in some ways. The nine leaves can be considered to have a master already, but not in my eyes.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What kind of existence is its master?” She became curious. In this location, there was a momentum untouchable by even emperors. Its master must have been quite mighty and frightening.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A dead person.” Li Qiye chuckled in response: “Just think about it, what type of people require this item? Of course, even for them, this is only a backup plan. No one would use it unless there was no other way. People of this level wouldn’t gamble on a twenty percent chance.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it has a master already, if you try and take it away, aren’t you…” She became worried. It was a reasonable doubt. After all, a master of this item was surely a terrorizing existence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what?” He interrupted her and laughed: “If I need something, it is the same regardless of whether it has a master or not, it’s completely up for grabs!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yonghuang was speechless. He said these high-handed words so casually. It was simply unreasonable, but that was not his nature; this was someone who spoke with his fist.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two talked along the way and made it to the entrance of the valley. There were many cultivators and experts standing here.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some released their blood energies and didn’t hesitate to show their strength publicly. Others hid their auras and identities. The few true masters were hiding in the shadows while gazing at everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, no one knew who the strongest at the valley was. Some even believed that Emperor Assailants have made it here. However, these characters would just quietly stay in the background.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fierce is here.” People quickly made way for the duo after seeing them and didn’t dare to block their path.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, some also felt relieved after seeing that it was only Li Qiye and Su Yonghuang. Fiercest was strong indeed and enough to make others tremble timidly. However, if the Lunargrasp Fairy and the True Martial Goddess were here as well, no one could contest him for the medicine!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The younger generation was fine with it, but for the dying crowd, they must have this medicine. Even if they were to face Li Qiye or Meng Zhentian, they would still risk it all and try to fight for the medicine. After all, nothing was more important and precious than living on.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, the absence of the other two women was a welcomed sight. At the very least, they still had a chance against Li Qiye instead of none.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone couldn’t help but mutter with dissatisfaction: “He’s so young, why would he want an immortal medicine?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, these were the old men. After all, they were rightfully annoyed that these young ones in their prime came here to compete with them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He might not need to use it, but he can let others have it. If he has it in his possession, he could definitely invite an Emperor Assailant! Plus, which cultivator dares to say he’ll live forever?” Another old man laughed and didn’t mind a young person like Li Qiye coming to join the fun.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People quickly stared at Li Qiye. The competition had yet to begin, yet a few have already considered him to be an enemy.</span></p>
