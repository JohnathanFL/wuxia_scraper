<p><b>Chapter 203: I’m Arrogant, I’m Domineering (1)</b></p><p>The overturned Qingxuan Yuanhe was both shocked and angry after seeing such a scene for it was completely outside of his expectations!</p><p>The Tetra-War Bronze Chariot really was not a treasure of his Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, it was an offering from the Heavenly God Sect. The elders of the Ancient Kingdom knew that it used to be the defining treasure of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but even after a long ponder, they couldn’t find out its mysteries.</p><p>Qingxuan Yuanhe finally took this chariot and the elders also agreed that if he could see through its profundity, then it would belong to him.</p><p>However, Qingxuan Yuanhe thought for a long time yet still couldn’t figure out the chariot’s enigma. Ultimately, he was at a dead end so he had to engrave refined jades and use them to move the bronze chariot.</p><p>After owning it for so long, he had never seen such a scene before. Until now, he only thought that the four bronze horses were only crafted from godly ore into treasures, but from today’s sight, this was not the case. The four bronze horses truly had their own life essence just like real horses!</p><p>“Kid, hand my treasure chariot over.” Qingxuan Yuanhe, in his bewildered exasperation, deafeningly shouted. He trod on the sky as his Saint energy turned into a bridge that inched closer. Each step exuded a magnificent Saint aura. Behind him was a Saint’s weapon like a powerful ocean capable of drowning all things.</p><p>Qingxuan Yuanhe, as a Heaven Restoration Saint, was not just for show. Even a Grand Saint would be easily massacred by him!</p><p>At this time, Li Qiye finally caught a glimpse of him. Even when facing a Heaven Restoration Saint from the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, he was still calm and nonchalant as he smilingly spoke: “Your treasure chariot? You should be ashamed for even bringing this up. The Tetra-War Bronze Chariot is the defining treasure of my Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Today, it comes back to my sect; it is simply a natural course of events!”</p><p>Li Qiye’s statement left many grand characters watching the battle to look at each other. They did not expect such an inside story. The puzzle behind how Li Qiye easily stole Qingxuan Yuanhe’s chariot was quickly solved. In the end, this was the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s defining treasure. It was clear that Qingxuan Yuanhe did not grasp the mysteries of this treasure!</p><p>“Ahh,” at this very moment, a scream resonated in the air as Wan Shengjian’s blood rained down from the blue sky. Niu Fen shattered his skull on the spot as his body fell down from the sky.</p><p>Many people were agasp witnessing such a scene. Wan Shengjian ah! This was a Grand Saint of the Heavenly God Sect. This was the disciple of the Heavenly God Sect’s ancestor, but today, he was killed by someone else. This was too bold; daring to kill his disciple, this was a provocation to the Heavenly God Sect’s ancestor!</p><p>Qingxuan Yuanhe, however, was not in the mood to save Wan Shengjian at this time. He coldly stared at Li Qiye with icy glints in his eyes, then chillingly spoke: “Little Devil, hand over the chariot, then my Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom will not pursue the matters today any longer!”</p><p>Li Qiye was too lazy to even glance at Qingxuan Yuanhe. He then replied: “No longer pursue? You think too highly of yourself, along with your Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom. Even if your Ancient Kingdom wants to let this go, I still won’t forgive your Ancient Kingdom!”</p><p>Li Qiye’s words made everyone glance at each other while thinking: ‘This kid is too much. Daring to talk like this, isn’t he afraid of biting his tongue!?’</p><p>“Little Devil, accept your death!” After his enraged words came out, the five palaces domain turned into a vast territory and immediately covered Li Qiye’s sky, wanting to suck him inside!</p><p>“Scram!” Li Qiye was tired of him so he sank his tone then tapped on the chariot.</p><p>“Neighhh,” the Tetra-War Bronze Chariot smothered the sky as it rushed forward while stomping heavily towards the approaching territory.</p><p>“Boom!” After a loud explosion, an incredible thing happened. The horses trampled and shattered the kingdom, resulting in another deafening “bang.” There was a huge crack that appeared in the middle of the five palaces domain as the now bloodied Qingxuan Yuanhe was kicked flying away by the four bronze horses.</p><p>Such a display rendered everyone breathless. This was a Heaven Restoration Saint ah, yet he was kicked flying away by four horses. No one would believe such a thing even if told, but this happened in front of everyone’s eyes.</p><p>After being kicked, Qingxuan Yuanhe violently vomited blood. As his expression greatly changed, he didn’t think about anything else and turned around to flee!</p><p>“Where are you escaping to…” Li Qiye didn’t feel like catching him, but Niu Fen wanted to be meritorious and thus, he no longer hid his strength. He shook his body and turned into an extremely giant snail in front of the world. This snail was much bigger than the snail ordinarily ridden by Li Qiye!</p><p>A giant snail with its head touching the stars and feet stomping the mountains and rivers. True Solution’s layers began to revolve around his body; each solution was like the waterfalls of the heavens. Each of them could single-handedly crush the sky!</p><p>A loud bang shook all of Ancient Sky City. The monstrous snail’s two hands reached out as if it was swatting a mosquito and slammed together. Qingxuan Yuanhe didn’t escape too far before he was smashed like a mosquito as fresh blood spilled in the sky along with terrifying sounds of broken bones!</p><p>When Qingxuan Yuanhe was dragged back, he was already on his last leg and covered in blood with no chance of escaping even if he wanted to.</p><p>While horrified by this scene, even though people knew that Li Qiye had ridden a snail before, no one thought that this snail was so heaven-defying like this. A Heaven Restoration Saint was mortally wounded with just one slap like a mosquito!</p><p>“Twelfth Solution connecting with the god!” Once Niu Fen turned back to an old man carrying Qingxuan Yuanhe back, he couldn’t help but to grin with excitement! Li Qiye passing the true solutions made him truly feel how terrifying the Eighteen Solutions of his Heavenly Ancestral Snail’s first branch was! Their race had a legend that once the Eighteenth Solution reaches grand accomplishment, then they could even massacre gods! At this point, he finally got a taste of this god-killing power!</p><p>“Junior, I am a royal member of the Ancient Kingdom; if you dare to kill me, you will not leave this ancient city alive!” At this moment, Qingxuan Yuanhe was at death’s door, but his momentum was still pressing down on others. Truly worthy of being a royal member of an Ancient Kingdom’s clan, always frighteningly aggressive.</p><p>Qingxuan Yuanhe’s words managed to change some people’s expressions. This truly was not just an empty threat! The Ancient Kingdom really possessed this power!</p><p>Li Qiye, standing on the Tetra-War Bronze Chariot, simply glared at him as he then slowly spoke: “The Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom… To tell the truth, I still haven’t considered you as a threat!”</p><p>“Haha, Young Noble, let me tear him to pieces.” Niu Fen grinned and smiled. With one command from Li Qiye, he would immediately tear Qingxuan Yuanhe apart!</p><p>“You dare…” Qingxuan Yuanhe’s face became deathly pale. At this moment, he knew he had met a little demon king. This kid in front simply was not afraid of the heavens nor the earth!</p><p>“There is nothing that I can’t do.” Li Qiye smiled and simply waved his sleeve without looking at Qingxuan Yuanhe one last time.</p><p>“Nooo…” At this moment, Qingxuan Yuanhe realized that his death had come! After a loud scream, Niu Fen tore the still-alive Qingxuan Yuanhe into two pieces. In a flash, his fate was destroyed! A generation Heaven Restoration Saint was ripped apart alive!</p><p>The visual impact of this scene was too devastating to all spectators — a Heaven Restoration Saint was simply killed like this. This was an expert of the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, this was the little brother of Mortal King Qingxuan, yet he was still torn apart!</p><p>Executing a royal family member of the Ancient Kingdom like this in front of everyone, how domineering was this! This was creating an unresolvable situation against the Ancient Kingdom! Even a renowned Heavenly King in the current generation would not dare to make such a maneuver.</p><p>However, such a tyrannical move was done by a fifteen, sixteen year old kid. At this point, everyone started to question whether the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was really in decline or not?</p><p>This was a great blow to the Heavenly God Sect’s morale. Such an invincible and high above existence who was impossible to defeat without the involvement of a Heavenly Sovereign, yet he was annihilated! Their confidence immediately collapsed with all morales plunged.</p><p>“Kill!” At this point, countless experts of the Nine Saint Demon Gate began their counterattack as their bloodlust surged. The Heavenly God Sect’s soldiers were now being pushed back. Such a reversal amazed all of the spectators.</p><p>At this time, Niu Fen stood by Li Qiye’s side without taking any action.</p><p>And Li Qiye’s eyes switched to the battle between Li Shuangyan and Dao Child Shengtian, and he saw that Dao Child Shengtian was being pushed back. Even though Li Shuangyan was ferocious, the Virtuous Paragon Life Treasure hovering above Dao Child Shengtian kept on releasing magical runes to stop Li Shuangyan’s attacks one after another.</p><p>“Heaven, Earth, Root!” Facing Li Shuangyan’s most aggressive attack, Dao Child Shengtian activated his strongest murderous move to stop the sharpest blow from Shuangyan.</p><p>With his deafening shout, the Virtuous Paragon Life Treasure on top of his head immediately released a mantra. This mantra blurred the heaven and earth back to the early primordial time. The three-words mantra acted as a resolute wall of the heaven and earth and stopped one hegemonic sword from Li Shuangyan.</p><p>“This is not only a Virtuous Paragon Life Treasure, it is also crafted from a seven runes treasure metal. What’s even worse is that three of those runes had become mantras! A Seven Treasure Three Mantra Virtuous Paragon Life Treasure, truly incredible!” Seeing the three mantra words, a person couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>Life Treasures were either crafted from Heavenly Beast’s Dao Bones or from a Grand Dao treasure metal. Grand Dao treasure metals were natural born dao runes from the heavens! The more runes there were, the more precious the treasure metal was!</p><p>If these runes could actually form words or sentences, then the power of this Life Treasure would double. However, if these runes actually formed the mantra of the heaven and earth, then it was even more amazing. These Life Treasures would surely suppress others at the same level!</p><p>Dao Child Shengtian’s Virtuous Paragon Life Treasure was incredible. It was refined by a Virtuous Paragon ancestor of theirs from a seven runes treasure metal. What was even more precious was that three of these runes had became mantras.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
