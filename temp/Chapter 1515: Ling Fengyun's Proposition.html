Everyone knew that Ling Fengyun was here for the Roaring Conch, seeking vengeance for the dead Conch Overlord.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was actually putting in good words for Li Qiye with a more pacifistic inching. It took everyone by surprise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He ought to do this.” One old ancestor agreed with his view and nodded: “The thirteen palaces is one and only in history. Heaven Spirit should work together to groom a talent like Li Qiye so he could become an emperor, the best of all time. At that point, those who help him will become meritorious heroes and the myriad races in the nine worlds will come to Heaven Spirit offering their tributes.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, many insightful ancestors and big shots agreed with Fengyun and felt that taking down Li Qiye would be too regrettable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this your personal opinion or are you representing everyone here?” Li Qiye became greatly amused and smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fengyun looked at him and slowly elaborated: “If you are willing to take a step back, I can deliberate with everyone here. And as for your feud with the Roaring Conch, I can be the arbitrator as well. You just need to confess your crimes and sincerely apologize and everything shall be dropped.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fengyun is indeed a wise character, to be so benevolent. Ordinary people can’t compare to him.” Many couldn’t help but sigh after hearing this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Brother Fengyun wishes for a truce, it isn’t hard either.” Shen Mengtian stared at Li Qiye for a long time before adding.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can also let go of this feud but there needs to be a deal.” Dualchild joined in.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No animosity lasts forever in this world.” Creek Bamboo finally spoke: “It just depends on whether you are willing or not.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the tense atmosphere that could erupt at any moment eased down due to Ling Fengyun’s change of attitude.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope they don’t fight.” Someone clench their fist and said: “If Heaven Spirit could have solidarity with six invincible characters protecting Li Qiye, he will definitely be unstoppable in the nine worlds. Who will be able to compete against him?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, many hoped for a peaceful outcome between the two sides since it would be very beneficial for Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the condition?” Li Qiye was not anxious at all in his response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Reincarnation Nine-Leaves!” Driedtree took the initiative before the others; “As long as you hand over the grass, everything is negotiable.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others glanced at each other and didn’t speak just yet.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you want the grass?” Li Qiye leisurely said: “This is a supreme immortal medicine. With it, one would have the chance to reincarnate with their previous memories. So many people have coveted this item throughout history. Even emperors want to keep it around as a backup plan for the future.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? This grass can actually do that?” Those who didn’t know about the medicine was shocked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Godhalt, everyone knew that it was an immortal medicine. Some even thought that it would grant eternal life but no one knew the exact details until now.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who wouldn’t want to be reborn again?” Even the most stoic ancestor swallowed their saliva with greed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was indeed a chance at rebirth with the Reincarnation Nine-Leaves. One leaf had a twenty percent chance of success. However, the outcome was not always the same. The chance of keeping one’s memories was even lower than a regular reincarnation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For other experts, this gamble might be worth it but an emperor wouldn’t necessarily want to place everything on such a low probability.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Shen Mengtian and the Stygian Monarch were gulping after hearing this and were clearly tempted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t strange at all. All of them outside of Ling Fengyun had a withering lifespan. Moreover, they have prolonged it many times in the past so that was no longer an option.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had two choices at this moment. Either wait for death or to take a chance in eating the grass. In their eyes, nothing was more tempting than a rebirth. Even if it was only twenty percent chance, they would still take it!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fengyun, on the other hand, was the youngest and full of vitality. Because of this, he was the only one who didn’t need the nine leaves.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is only one, how will you all divide it?” Li Qiye chuckled and stared at the group.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group reached a consensus in a short time. Of course, outsiders didn’t know their agreements.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“None of your business.” Shen Mengtian said: “Just hand over the grass and everything is negotiable. We might not even hurt you at all.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators using their mirror became anxious. Some started to see the dawn, a chance for this storm to end.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then there must be other conditions?” Li Qiye wasn’t surprised at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group glanced at each other and Fengyun began: “Gentlemen, if you don’t mind, I can act as the mediator. As long as Li Qiye hand the grass over, everyone won’t need to make it difficult for him. He just needs to make a small compensation instead.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s Ling Fengyun for you, worthy of his fame as a hero. He is so much more benevolent compared to others and really loves talents.” A few older characters praised him right away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The discerning crowd could see that though the other five claimed to be here for revenge, their true goal was most likely the nine leaves.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unlike the others, Ling Fengyun didn’t need the nine-leaves at his age. To a large extent, he was here to pay off his life debt to the Roaring Conch.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short time, the parties became quiet. Peace was indeed possible for them since their ultimate goal was the nine leaves. Obtaining justice for their juniors came after.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, they would be glad to teach Li Qiye a lesson as well. However, Fengyun’s change of attitude as the mediator forced them to give him some face.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They might be more powerful than him but he was too young and vigorous. Thus, sensibilities were the right course of action.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, they found it hard to accept if it was only a light punishment. After all, letting Li Qiye off easy would be damaging towards their prestige as well as their sects’ position.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, the five of them came to a tacit understanding after glancing at each other for a bit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We don’t need to pursue this any further.” In the end, Stygian said: “Outside of the nine leaves, Li Qiye need to hand over the method to cultivate the thirteen palaces. With that, all past feuds will be wiped out!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have no objection to this.” Shen Mengtian smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can also accept this.” Creek Bamboo nodded.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dualchild and Driedtree agreed as well. Their purpose, in the beginning, was the leaves since they had no enmity against Li Qiye. Why would they say no for a chance of obtaining thirteen palaces?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone held their breath before their mirror and felt that this was impossible. The thirteen palaces was a unique achievement.

Just how precious was it? It was even above Immortal Physique Laws.
