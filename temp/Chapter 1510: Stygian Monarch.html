In a short period of time, Heaven Spirit seemed to be exploding with news.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is insane! Both of them are Emperor Assailants, but it isn’t time for the Heaven’s Will competition just yet. If that day comes, just how many more existences of this level will come out?!” Even characters of the ancestor level were amazed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think the Roaring Conch didn’t want to give up and spent a lot of effort to beseech Ling Fengyun. They want to use this chance to re-establish their prestige and pick up the pieces that were trampled by Li Qiye.” A knowledgeable ancestor said: “As for Creek-Bamboo, I’m not quite sure. He must be aiming for the medicine of immortality.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many juniors and elders in the sect agreed with this analysis.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The conch suffered heavy losses this time. Their most promising talent died along with their strongest ancestor. This meant that the conch has lost their successor and their strongest ace. Under such conditions, they wouldn’t be able to hold on to their status. Other sects that have been wanting to usurp them could strike at any time and even divide their sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, they tried their best to invite Ling Fengyun for revenge and to be their backing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After two Emperor Assailants announced their messages, the frightened world paid attention to Li Qiye’s actions. They wanted to know his response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Right at this moment, an overbearing energy surged to the sky. One could see a huge figure over at the Jade Sea.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Li Qiye exerting his avatar. His head was above the firmament while his feet crushed the earth. His eyes looked like two suns hanging in the sky. At this moment, he has released all of his blood energy. This terrifying mass looked like a tsunami assaulting the sun. Even the stars would be cut down like specks of dust.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he held nothing back in his effort to deter the world while sweeping across all existences.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One or two random dogs come out and think it is enough to force me to submit? You all think too highly of yourselves! Don’t think that you’re actually an Emperor Assailant after exchanging a few moves with an emperor!” His tyrannical voice flowed across Heaven Spirit: “Very well, come. Name the time and place; make sure to come together so that I can kill everyone at once to avoid wasting time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world turned silent.

They’re much more powerful than Zhentian and the prince.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If assailants were random dogs in his eyes, could anyone be considered an expert in this world then?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ancestor murmured: “How imperious!

His overbearing nature is much more than this, a few sentences can’t describe it.” An expert replied: “I feel that he is definitely strong enough to kill an Emperor Assailant. His personality is one that stays true to his word. His arrogance is predicated on his absolute confidence and strength.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is Li Qiye who will be the Eternal Prime Emperor!” Some people had a blind fanaticism towards Li Qiye at this moment: “No one but him will become emperor in this generation. No one can deter his merciless path!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There might only be one Fiercest in all of history.” No one mocked his declaration. Instead, they became sentimental from his achievements. They felt that this was how he should be acting, the natural order of the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a world of the strong. Once a person reaches a particular level, many people would have blind faith in them and give them their unconditional support!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” After Li Qiye answered Ling Fengyun and Creek-Bamboo, a portal seemed to be opening back at Godhalt.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Booom!” Endless darkness enveloped all of Godhalt and eventually spread across all of Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Count me in.” A supreme voice in the darkness coldly uttered: “Killing my descendant is a crime that deserves death!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People shuddered after hearing this voice.

The charming spirits believe that this is one of their race’s primordial artifacts left behind by the charming spirit progenitor. Back in that era, countless experts in the nine worlds desired this artifact, and countless charming spirit lineages demanded it, including one sect with three emperors. The charming spirits back then believed that this treasure belonged to all spirits, so they demanded the surrender of this treasure.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, the older ancestor turned silent for a moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The abyss’ founders refused?” A younger ancestor broke the silence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, their founders refused.” The old ancestor nodded: “This artifact is too tempting and powerful.

They killed numerous experts from the nine worlds. Some said that these founders’ darkness shrouded the worlds during that battle.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young ancestors were amazed after hearing this.

After the war, only three founders managed to survive, and the Stygian Monarch is the last one to make it to the present.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young ancestor didn’t know that the Spirit Abyss had such a glorious past.

The future generations might not be privy to this information since the abyss stopped coming out after the war. However, because of its existence and the Stygian Monarch, no one had any ideas about the abyss again. Rumor has it that this treasure is definitely stronger than an Immortal Emperor True Treasure and maybe a bit weaker than the Trident.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This came as a shock to the ancestors here.
