It was an absolute suppression; even stronger forces would find it impossible to resist!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xshhh—” Under its power, the roots from the ground withered at a speed visible to the naked eye. They had lost their support and scattered all over the ground like grains of sand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” The entire world began to shake at this moment. The land became increasingly violent as if it was being turned upside-down. It seemed that a cataclysm was swiftly approaching.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An invincible power was drilling out of the earth in order to tear apart the dao chapter and its suppression.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” Li Qiye snorted. His vitality rushed out as he opened his mind and sea of memories. “Boom!” Untouchable dao laws instantly drilled into the ground as if wanting to penetrate it completely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A boundless world surged in an instant.

It was extremely ancient as if it had existed since the dawn of time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Li Qiye took out a bronze box and placed it on the chapter, instantly empowering it!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next, he placed the green lantern housing the dark flame right below it. This dark flame that could incinerate all in this world at his command jumped up!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t care where you are hiding and I don’t care whether there will be reincarnation or not!” Li Qiye coldly uttered: “If you have given up on this world, then get the hell out of here! This new life was brought to this world by me, so I am responsible for it and will be its supervisor from now on! No one will be allowed to interfere. From now on, I am responsible for its life and its future! Interfere and I won’t just let the dao chapter suppress this place! I will even turn over this land and kill everything! Trust me when I say I shall stay true to my word!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His overbearing words echoed across the world.

No one would be able to take it lest they risk forming an irreconcilable feud with him! At that time, he would use all of his means and power to annihilate his enemies!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as he was determined, it didn’t matter who he faced.

As long as it was someone who knew about the Dark Crow, they wouldn’t easily declare war!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye emphatically declared: “Very well, from today on, I am the highest supervisor for this new life.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao stood there in a daze for she was overwhelmed by his current domineering nature. This was her first time witnessing his authority! In the nine heavens and ten earths, he alone was invincible!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Overbearing, invincible, all-encompassing, suppressive… she could only use these adjectives to describe him at this moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Poof!” The dark flame from the lamp oozed out and started to incinerate everything along the lines of the dao chapter.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zzz—” Eventually, the flame burned the chapter into this world! It then returned to the lamp so Li Qiye could put it away.

Finally, he summoned the group of immortal medicines. They breathed in deeply after coming out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After looking around, the Ginseng Ancestor murmured: “I see, this is a primal ground, no wonder we can’t absorb the majestic lifeforce at Godhalt.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye stared at the group and said: “Two of you will stay behind to take care of this new life.

They bid farewell to the Soldier Tree and soulvine one after another. After all, they had always been together since the days at the garden of the immortals.

This could perhaps be their final farewell, they may never meet again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goodbye, brothers.” The Soldier Tree and soulvine didn’t want this either, but they still waved to the group.
