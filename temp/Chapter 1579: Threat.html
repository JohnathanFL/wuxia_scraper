Due to the lack of communication, she was certain the Zi Cuining has been placed under house arrest. If Cuining could go to Pearl, it would be a chance for the monarch to rescue her then counterattack together.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bright Monarch, you’re making this hard for me. The sect master can’t come here right now since she’s too worried about Ancestor Shan and the others being trapped in the hall. She’s busy researching the mysteries of the hall and can’t leave. If you don’t mind, you can go to the sect and see her…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monarch interrupted him with a head shake: “Elder, I have already given my answer. Either the sect master comes here to see me in person or bring a signed, official decree!"</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder quickly responded: “Bright Monarch, why bother adhering to an old law, you need to be more flexible since this matter is very beneficial for your future. Just come to the sect and your potential will be unlimited…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder, no need to waste more time. We’ll do this by the rules only.” She stopped him again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Monarch, this makes it quite difficult for me. If I go back empty-handed, how can I explain it to the sect master and ancestors?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such a trivial matter, is there really a need to go about in circle like this? Both Gu Zun and Ye Jiuzhou are too prudent right now compared to back then. Gu Zun used to be quite domineering with no qualm for anything. If this was him in the past, he would directly attack Pearl City. Why bother resorting to tricks like this? How disappointing.” Li Qiye laughed and shook his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been quietly sitting there so Elder Sun didn’t pay attention to him. But now, he was boasting shamelessly right away to the visible annoyance of the elder.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, who are you!?!” The elder immediately shouted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at the elder before grinning leisurely: “Just a nosy outsider.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bright Monarch, what is going on? This is a confidential matter of our sect, how can there be an outsider here to steal our secrets? You know that he isn’t part of the sect yet you still brought him here? This is blatant favoritism and lawbreaking…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, don’t bother trying to assign some blame.” Li Qiye answered instead while waving his sleeve dismissively: “To sum it up, you just want to seize Pearl City. Sigh, Ye Jiuzhou is old and Gu Zun is too timid now. Fine, come back, tell the two of them to scram.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, do not insult my ancestors!” Elder Sun shouted: “Men, capture him!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two rows of experts stood up and surrounded Li Qiye with a murderous aura. There was no intention of capturing him alive.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Monarch, you need to give the sect an answer for this...” The elder spoke gravely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They wanted nothing more than to escalate the situation in order to have justification for a military installation at Pearl.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” All the experts went flying in an instant with spurting blood. With a series of loud bangs, they all fell outside of the hall and couldn’t get up at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t move an inch. No one could see how he attacked earlier.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I shall give you an answer.” Li Qiye spread out his hand before the elder could finish speaking. It resembled a monstrous mountain slamming down on the elder.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was aghast and immediately roared to summon his treasure for a direct confrontation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” But the result was still the same as before. His treasure was impressive indeed but it failed to protect him. He was blown flying by one palm attack and spat out blood as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!” The tea-serving disciple turned pale and quickly helped the elder up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who the hell are you?!” As an elder from Heaven Suppression, he wasn’t just all talk. However, he couldn’t withstand a single palm strike today so it was apparently just how terrible his foe was. This was definitely the strength of a Godking; such a person couldn’t be nameless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye. Maybe you have heard of my name.” Li Qiye chuckled in response.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiercest!” Even someone as experienced as the elder faltered backward in horror.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was truly startled. Fiercest was too famous right now and just his title alone could scare many people.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He annihilated the Space Trample Mountain and banished Soaring Immortal back then. This battle record shocked all of Mortal Emperor so everyone would feel dread when hearing his name.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone knew who “Fiercest” was. On the other hand, “Li Qiye” stopped being used by others for a multitude of reasons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heaven Suppression was illustrious at the Grand Sea but the elder knew that Fiercest had wanton regards for anything. There was no chance he would be scared of their sect! Him being an elder wouldn’t make Li Qiye think twice about killing him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good.” Li Qiye read his demeanor and chuckled: “It’s good that you know fear despite being from Heaven Suppression. I would have killed a naive fool otherwise.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Sun took another step back after hearing this.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disciple helping him tried to be brave but still stammered: “Our, our Heaven Suppression isn’t, isn’t afraid of anyone.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Sun jumped from fear and quickly pulled the youth behind him. This was his youngest disciple. The kid has always been obedient so he was very satisfied and didn’t wish to see Fiercest kill him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s your name?” Li Qiye smirked while staring at the youth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Sun took another step back to shield his disciple and replied instead: “Li Qiye, our Heaven Suppression City has no grudges with you, why are you interfering with us?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye ignored the elder and looked at the youth behind him: “What is your name?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My, my name is Lin Qi.” The boy found enough courage to eventually respond with his head held high.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye was amused by this boy and eventually waved his sleeve: “Scram, all of you. I don’t want to see any of you again. Go back and tell Gu Zun and Ye Jiuzhou that I, Li Qiye, have arrived!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Sun was an unpleasant sight to behold at this moment. He didn’t trouble the monarch any further. The wisest thing to do against Fiercest was to run away in order to stay alive. Otherwise, regardless of how powerful one might be and their backing, it would all be useless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder immediately left with his disciples and the others with the greatest speed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young noble, Ancestor Ye will have an excuse after this commotion.” The monarch smiled wryly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what? They want to capture Pearl City regardless of whether there is a justification or not.” Li Qiye said flatly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She sighed softly in response and understood this logic as well. The only thing she could do right now was to buy time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder how the sect master is doing?” She worriedly said. The ancestors were actually safe being locked in the Black Dragon Hall. On the other hand, Zi Cuining’s life might be in the hands of Ye Jiuzhou.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re worrying too much.” Li Qiye shook his head in response: “And you’re underestimating her as well. Jiuzhou is strong but Cuining has the Black Dragon Spear. If she really wants to leave, he can’t stop her anyway! She must have a reason for staying behind.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope so.” The monarch said feebly. She understood that that the sect master was an insightful person and wouldn’t have easily fallen into the hands of the enemy. Nevertheless, her perilous situation was still worrisome.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ignore these trivial matters. Come with me to Discover, I’ll let you meet someone.” Li Qiye said flatly.</span></p>
