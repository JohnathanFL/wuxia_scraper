All other creatures seemed so tiny beneath its shadow, not worth mentioning at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People could only look up to this tree with fear in their mind. Any existence would feel that they couldn’t reach the apex, completely helpless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, All-Martial General also shared this same sentiment with a tinge of powerlessness.

He felt that her choice was quite insightful and visionary.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He has destroyed the Ancestral Terra even before becoming an Immortal Emperor.

Li Qiye was already frightening enough now. After becoming emperor, the general could only describe Li Qiye with one moniker - Eternal Prime Emperor!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, he wasn’t the only one with this thought. Many experts at the pinnacle of Heaven Spirit were trembling as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before shouldering the Heaven’s Will, this was his capability.

Though no one could see him, they could feel his gaze sweeping by all of Heaven Spirit to their horror.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the strongest masters didn’t dare to face him at this moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he turned his gaze towards the Bonesea. His eyes became extremely profound.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come out and fight?” A second challenge echoed and terrified the crowd.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he wasn’t challenging the experts of this world since he was aiming for the Bonesea.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was completely silent as if no creature has heard his words.

They prostrated and hoped that he would recall his power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, all of the cultivators here misunderstood him and thought that he was challenging Heaven Spirit’s inhabitants.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the invincible masters began to flee without saying goodbye to anyone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, no one in Heaven Spirit was worthy of fighting him.

The place was still mysterious and normal looking. No one would give it a second glance outside of Li Qiye!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He eventually retracted his gaze as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want a fight but unfortunately, they all want to hide with their tail tucked between their legs. What a shame.” His words resounded sonorously across the world, robbing its inhabitants of their colors.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boss, who would dare to fight you now? Please, recall your power already.” Some of the bowing crowd couldn’t help but beg.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor Assailants were running away as well while thinking that Li Qiye was asking for more opponents.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this key juncture, no one dared to oppose him, let alone fighting him. Even assailants would be slaughtered by him since the three ancestral trees failed as well.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This misunderstanding wasn’t resolved in the end.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A pity.” In the end, he could only sigh since he couldn’t do anything if the Bonesea and the Divine Tree Ridge chose against coming into being.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” As the crowd was trembling in fear, the verdant tree blotting out the world suddenly disappeared with a loud noise. A boundless green radiance fell upon Heaven Spirit. These green wisps fluttered downward, creating a beautiful and dreamy spectacle.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this tree gone, many experts stare back towards the Divine Tree Ridge. They found that it was finally back to its original position of stretching through Godhalt. It was still one of the twelve burial grounds as if nothing has happened.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People rubbed their eyes and felt that this was only a dream.

Of course, this was obvious looking at the destroyed great powers as well. The ultimate massacre just now was indeed reality.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though it was over, a somber serenity overwhelmed Heaven Spirit for a long while. Experts and lineages didn’t dare to voice their opinion. To embellish the atmosphere a little, one could even say that no one dared to breathe loudly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivators in this world chose to hide in their home instead of showing their face. The battle today has shattered their courage. A few masters who just got out of their coffins immediately crawled back in.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be smart and tuck your tail in this generation, do not cause trouble!” Some Emperor Assailants even warned their descendants before running back to their lairs.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye returned to his Tetra-war Bronze Chariot and casually threw the ancient jade from the Dream Empyrean and the primordial weapon of the abyss at Su Yonghuang.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Try your best researching these two items.
