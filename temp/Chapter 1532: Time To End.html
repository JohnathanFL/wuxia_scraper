The suffocated crowd had sweat all over.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remember that these three represented the top existences for Heaven Spirit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if they weren’t Emperor Assailants, there was only a little gap.

Just how terrible was its power? Many people recalled what Li Qiye has said earlier. Even if Dualchild’s father was in this world, he would still have to take the long way around this tree.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remember that his father was an emperor. Just thinking about this terrified everyone. The power of this tree has exceeded their imagination. This prompted the question - what the heck was it?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though after withering, it turned into the Divine Tree Ridge.

Their heartbeat became rapid because they knew that this was the end for this sect.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the five, Shen Mengtian, Stygian, and Dualchild were killed in battle. Ling Fengyun has surrendered. The only one left was Creek Bamboo.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, three great powers have been annihilated.

An air of despair ravaged this place. Just a while ago, the experts were celebrating and thought that the three ancestral trees could protect them from this disaster. Alas, it was inevitable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s do this.” Li Qiye’s voice came from the nine heavens.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qiye, no, Young Noble Li, I surrender. Our Ancestral Terra will surrender.” Creek Bamboo soared to the sky and raised the white flag.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will give up everything and surrender. From now on, The Ancestral Terra is yours!” He beseeched.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s too late.” The faint voice responded: “I have given you an opportunity but you didn’t value it.

We lost today and we will hand over the terra, this is our everything, will you still not spare us?” Creek Bamboo begged loudly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You didn’t have this thought in the beginning and only changed your mind after facing despair. There is no medicine for regrets in this world.” The voice leisurely said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-1a87"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Noble Li, as the saying goes, killing someone is only making their head fall on the ground…” Creek Bamboo continued begging.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="#footnote-1a87">[1]</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, no need to talk to me about morality or act all pitiful. The grand dao is merciless, there’s no room for mercy. After making the wrong choice, you must face it bravely. The high heaven does not forgive the weak or bully the strong. Though I am not the high heaven, I will not give the enemy a second chance. If I were to lose, I would also face a grotesque end without regrets.” Li Qiye was unmoved.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one said anything during this cry for mercy from Creek Bamboo.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing else to say since this was the world of cultivation where the law of the jungle reigned.
