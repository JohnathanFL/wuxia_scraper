<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People held their breaths after hearing Jianshi’s direct refusal. They were slightly moved by her words. Not many would dare to refuse Zhentian in Heaven Spirit, especially among the younger generation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Jianshi had no qualms in doing so, making people realize and remember that Void Imperfection was a top lineage in this world, a beacon of the charming spirits. Despite knowing that Zhentian could become emperor, she still dared to oppose him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should know that if I want to board, the two of you can’t stop me.” He reiterated with a calm voice. Zhentian didn’t put on an aggressive tone or needlessly postured. His insipid words were enough to show his great confidence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She clearly uttered: “I know. We can’t stop Senior if you wish to do so, but we will still try!” Her attitude didn’t change from its initial firmness. She didn’t give the slightest leeway.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They weren’t afraid of Zhentian, only the slumbering Fairy. There was still room for redemption if Zhentian were to take action, but if Fairy were to do something, everyone would die!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An existence of the emperor level, once berserk, wouldn’t only kill everyone here. She might even slaughter everyone in the Heaven Spirit World! They didn’t wish to see this at all, especially in Li Qiye’s absence.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, Zhentian movingly spoke: “Void Imperfection is indeed a leading lineage of the charming spirits. Schoolmasters, there’s no need to be so hostile towards me. We are part of the same race and I do hope that it can flourish. The two of you should know that we all have the duty to revitalize the charming spirits and let its prestige spread far and wide.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people here understood what he was implying. Why was Void Imperfection siding with Li Qiye, a human?! Many spirits were unhappy with this choice.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our actions will also strengthen the charming spirit race. Alas, we picked a different path to Senior Zhen.” Ruyan faintly smiled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very well.” Zhentian wasn’t angered. He peacefully said: “Different paths will seek different things. However, today, I just want to talk to Daoist Li. I shall board regardless of whether the two of you agree or not.” His conduct was appropriate for a true master.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian’s rhetoric was winning people over. A supreme individual was indeed different. He spoke with admirable elegance without aggressiveness or an imperious attitude.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As an Emperor Reserve, he was a genius infinitely close to an Immortal Emperor. He could feel something strange in the boneship. Despite not knowing the details, his intuition was telling him that it was extraordinary. This was the reason for his actions, wanting to wait for Li Qiye was only secondary.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi replied: “I’m afraid you will be disappointed. You must get past us if you want to board!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her answer made people think that they were overstepping their bounds. Of course, no one dared to criticize them because the Void Imperfection Schools was still a top power. Moreover, it wasn’t shameful at all for the younger generation to lose to Meng Zhentian. Even a commendable loss was still worthy of pride. Not everyone was qualified to become his enemies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Schoolmaster Zhuo, there’s no need to be so aggressive.” At this time, someone else interjected: “If you two wish to spar, the Extreme Yang Monarch and I can entertain you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speaker was Daoist Lin from the Immaculate Expanse!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monarch smiled and added: “Brother Lin is right, we’ll take you two on for a bit.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, these top young experts from the charming spirit race were on Zhentian’s side. Their sects were in full support of him as well and felt that he was the most promising candidate.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you two want to play, I’ll play along.” A steady voice answered the two of them instead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two people drifted through the sky. One of the youths had a regal aura while the other looked ordinary. When they walked together, all attention would be on the regal youth!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were Daoist Puresun and the Profound Monarch! It was easy to tell which was which just by their conflicting auras.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Extreme Yang Monarch and Daoist Lin were alarmed to see Puresun. They considered themselves to be very strong among the younger generation, but after the previous exchange with Puresun, they realized the great gap between them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gu Chun’s four branches...” People began to murmur to themselves, especially the charming spirits. They simply didn’t understand why their lineages would choose to go with Li Qiye instead of Zhentian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Extreme Yang Monarch and Daoist Lin couldn’t respond right away. Eventually, Lin spoke with a hint of anger: “Puresun Island Lord, we are not afraid of you since we aren’t afraid of anyone. It is just that we don’t wish to go all out against you just yet. Otherwise, we still have the means—”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just be frank about being inferior to someone else, there’s nothing to be ashamed of.” Profound sneered after seeing Lin trying to gain some face: “Losing to my senior brother is an honor, so why bother prop yourselves up?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puresun was too honest and nice, but Profound wasn’t like that at all. He was an aggressive bully that would never miss the chance to mercilessly suppress his enemies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” The expressions of the other two turned ugly after hearing this, but they didn’t know what to do!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The four branches have many outstanding geniuses.” Finally, Zhentian replied from his carriage: “Fellow Daoists, I have already heard of your thunderous fame long ago.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People glanced at Puresun and Profound. It was absolutely a great honor to be praised this highly by Zhentian. Their worth would rise by quite a bit after this. Some would feel as if they were walking on air if Zhentian were to praise them like this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brothers had different reactions. Puresun simply smiled with a carefree demeanor as if Zhentian was just another person praising him, but Profound became much more cautious of Zhentian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the future war for the Heaven’s Will, Profound’s attitude was very clear. He would support whoever his brother chose. It was apparent at this moment that Puresun had chosen Li Qiye, so despite his general annoyance towards Li Qiye, Profound still stood by his brother’s side.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that case, it meant that Meng Zhentian would become their enemy in the future.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puresun gave a leisurely smile and said: “Daoist Meng, you are matchless, so is there a need to make it difficult for juniors like us? How about letting this go? When Brother Li returns, I will let him know so that the two of you can talk.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew what was in the boneship right now, so he felt the same way as Ruyan and Jianshi. If he had to pick between Zhentian and Fairy as an opponent, he would definitely pick Zhentian. If Fairy were to take action, the outcome would be unpredictable. It could even bring about destruction to Heaven Spirit!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His reply and address towards Meng Zhentian made many people gasp! Daoist Meng — who would dare to address Zhentian in this manner? Not to mention the younger generation, even the previous wouldn’t dare to speak to Zhentian like this! Keep in mind that this was someone who even Immortal Emperor Ta Kong called “older brother.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Puresun spoke in such a natural and idle manner even when facing Meng Zhentian. This was another reason why Profound respected his brother so much. Regardless of the situation, his brother was always confident like this, someone with an invincible bearing and mentality!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People had to take a second look at Puresun. There was a lack of public condemnation, but they felt that this man was being too careless. It was strange to consider himself to be on the same level as Zhentian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Zhentian refused to take no for an answer: “Since I’m already here, I should just wait for Daoist Li to come back. His heaven-defying means have completely impressed me. I shall wait on the ship.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was all too curious about what was on the boat. Even a powerful existence like him felt that whatever was on it, it was absolutely unfathomable and without equal in this world!</span></p>
