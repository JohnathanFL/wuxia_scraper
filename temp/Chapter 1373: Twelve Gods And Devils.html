He stood to the side and watched the fight between the Diamond God and Resplendent with relish.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes brightened when he saw the Diamond God’s golden body with its buddhist aura completely unscathed in the face of Resplendent’s barrage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really is the Indestructible Diamond Physique.” He nodded his head after noticing some clues.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Sparks went flying. Resplendent’s spear looked like a flood-dragon leaving the water. It struck the Diamond God continuously to no avail while this avatar continued to zealously attack Resplendent in a suicidal fashion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was driving Resplendent crazy. He was obviously stronger than this Diamond God, but he was the one retreating before this crazed onslaught. Anyone else would have died countless times already. The problem was that this Diamond God was unkillable. Even Resplendent’s most destructive attack could only leave a tiny mark on its body; a full penetration was impossible.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, the furious godking shouted: “Get the hell out of my face!” He finally resorted to his ace and slammed down with a huge hammer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This blow could shatter the celestials in the sky. It carried the might of a true god, making it seem as if one was here in person.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The Diamond God was mercilessly blown away by this hammer and made a huge pit in the muddy ground. Its chest was caved in quite a bit. It looked like the hammer had successfully shattered his torso.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Resplendent held the hammer as it emitted a flashing multi-colored brilliance. It seemed to be coming back to life with the power of a true god, turning its master into a deity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This weapon was called the Hammer of the True God, an artifact left behind by Resplendent’s ancestor. Since he had the same divine bloodline running through his body, he was able to exert its power in full.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That hammer is quite powerful. At the same level and without an imperial weapon, another Heavenly Godking would be killed in a single blow.” Many people were in awe before this scene. A Godking was scary enough, so one with a divine weapon was even more fearful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” The Diamond God stood up. Its shattered chest unexpectedly healed without leaving behind a single trace of damage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” It sent out two punches towards the divine hammer without apprehension.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Each strike of the hammer sent out explosions. Without a doubt, Resplendent had the upper hand with his divine hammer as he unleashed his onslaught on the Diamond God.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under this crazy onslaught, the Diamond God’s chest, shoulders, and even its head slowly deforming. However, with a buzz, the parts that were smashed quickly healed, then it continued to fight again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators were dumbfounded by this scene while feeling creeped out. Even Resplendent and his divine hammer couldn’t kill this avatar. This was too terrifying.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s definitely the Indestructible Diamond Physique.” Someone declared the verdict.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, fortunately for him, despite being unable to kill his foe, he was still able to suppress the Diamond God and found some breathing room.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed after noticing Resplendent heaving a sigh of relief: “So one isn’t enough, I see. Very well, here’s one more then! Since you have been fighting a god, try fighting a devil this time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, another bang resounded. One more figure emerged from the kingdom of blood. The crowd was astonished once more since it was another identical Li Qiye.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distinguishing factor was the dark, evil flame surging from this figure, making it seem just like a devil king. However, when it hid its aura, it suddenly disappeared and was nowhere to be found!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Void Devil, one of the twelve avatars from the kingdom of blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The crowd was astounded. While Resplendent was keeping the Diamond God at bay, his back was suddenly struck, causing him to tumble in the air while spitting out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Void Devil appeared behind him out of nowhere and gave him a ferocious blow. Even the powerful Resplendent couldn’t detect Void moving behind him for a sneak attack.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” He immediately stomped on the air to garner enough momentum for another smash. However, Void disappeared. Even after opening his heavenly gaze, Resplendent couldn’t find it!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Diamond came knocking once more. Its entire body was a weapon as it lunged forward with a fierce momentum.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Resplendent had no choice but to give up on Void and slammed his hammer onto Diamond.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom! Boom!” He unleashed his fury on Diamond instead. Alas, with the diamond physique, all of these attacks were useless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The Void Devil appeared again between the two and unleashed a palm straight to Resplendent’s chest.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite being on guard, he was still struck by this palm and spat out blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Although this palm couldn’t kill him, being wounded by an ambush like this was humiliating. He immediately tried to kill Void, but it disappeared again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Diamond came forward so Resplendent had to worry about Diamond.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a scene made people gasp. Two identical Li Qiyes; one was a god and the other a devil. One was unkillable regardless how it was attacked while the other was both omnipresent yet nowhere to be found. This was a perfect combination, leaving others completely at a loss for words!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the Void Physique!” Daoist Puresun once again murmured to himself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye was sitting on the deck, not caring about the fight between the deities and Resplendent. He glanced over at Cao Guojian and said: “I thought about killing you last time, but you got lucky. It’s time to end you now.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye had already provoked Resplendent and now he wanted to fight Cao Guojian as well — this rendered the crowd speechless. This youth was arrogant beyond common sense. Of course, he did have the strength to back it up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guojian was enraged after being viewed as a fish on a chopping board. He was still a Grand Godking at the very least, so how could he handle being looked down on by a junior in this unbearable manner? How could he show his face to the world again?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, come fight me then!” Guojian also reached the shore while angrily pointing at Li Qiye. He didn’t think that Li Qiye had the power to defeat him while fighting Resplendent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and replied: “Very well, I’ll take your worthless head today.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guojian felt angrier and angrier due to Li Qiye’s attitude. With a loud blast, his blood energy soared to the sky. The aura of a Grand Godking came crashing down alongside a surging energy from the great sword in his hand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” One more devil that looked like Li Qiye came out from the kingdom of blood.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had the same evil flame as the previous one, but its temperature was even hotter. Its flame engulfed the sky and turned into two huge wings. Its name was the Furious Devil.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its fiery wings turned into a pair of sharp sabers that began to attack Guojian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guojian shouted: “Show me what you got!” His great sword hovered in the sky and produced a hymn. Shortly afterward, countless swords appeared in the air and retaliated with murderous intent.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank! Clank! Clank!” A contest between the blades and swords ensued. Furious’ dual sabers turned into a whirlwind that blocked the incoming sword barrage. Alas, despite this defensive vortex providing an impregnable protection, Furious was still forced back by the countless swords.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” Furious was finally enraged after being pushed back. It howled, signaling the flame behind him to spread even more at an insane speed. Its body became incomparably big while fueled by the flame.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle prowess of this devil crazily rose by several dozen times or even a hundredfold. This allowed Furious to reach the same level as Cao Guojian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” Its flame swept by and instantly crushed the numerous swords in the sky. Next, Furious directly thrust the sabers towards Guojian.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” With a battle cry, Guojian unleashed a slash capable of severing the stars straight at Furious without holding anything back!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Prior to this, Furious was definitely not at the Godking realm. However, it soared to match Cao Guojian, astounding the crowd.</span></p>
