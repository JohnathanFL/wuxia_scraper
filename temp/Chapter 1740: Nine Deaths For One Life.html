I shall trade my death earlier for your Heaven’s Wills.” The ashes turned back to Li Qiye. This reconstruction process was different than the automatic recovery conducted by one’s own body. It was a reversing process that eventually reconstructed Li Qiye’s body and true fate.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood there - deathly pale - on the verge of falling down at any moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Death Scripture!” World Emperor was aware of the artifact.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Death Record, one of the four arts of the scripture - one fate accumulated from three deaths, one item formed from six deaths, one life changed from nine deaths, and eighteen deaths to reach the high heavens.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A while ago, Li Qiye used a supreme method to assume his strongest form while letting Old Xian, South Emperor, and Bloodbull Godfiend kill him. This was his eighth death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He truly died again for the ninth time during this ambush.

His hands became bright as he pushed them down to seal everything. This force could imprison a supreme true immortal and all the devil kings.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His title and twelve Heaven’s Wills weren’t only for show.

They were not facing him but an ancient power that originated from the start of the world. It was the power of a Heavenly Scripture! The oldest of forces in the universe.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The six wills were sealed and seemed to be disappearing from the world.

You are still underestimating me, watch this.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, the twisting golden, silver, and iron lights glowed brilliantly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The three grand dao and the twelve laws instantly floated above his head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s time for me to harvest, no one can stop me!” Li Qiye coldly uttered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along, he didn’t utilize the other arts of the Death Scripture outside of the Death Record. His whole plan was to wait for this moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The record became resplendent with the nine petals like stars illuminating everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The timeworn laws that were locking the six wills also wrapped around the second of the twelve laws. In the past, he fused the first law with the Heaven’s Will from the nine worlds. He intended on fusing these six wills with the second law.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not good!” World Emperor was startled while the other twelve knew that something bad was going to happen.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.” In the blink of an eye, the second law wished to become one with the six wills. The owners of the wills felt the robbing process.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” The world shook and quaked with a new arrival. This person was resplendent and presided above the gods. Even emperors with six wills here were overshadowed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could give birth to the yin and yang, master the universe, and end the eternal river of time!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">World Emperor has finally arrived with his real body since he had no other choice!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” Visual phenomena appeared in the sky as well as the power of the tribulations, capable of judging all living beings. Even an apex twelve-will emperor was subjected to this arbitration.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavenly Execution!” The Grand Emperors had nothing to fear after their ascension but there was a chill running down their spine the moment they saw this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a twelve-will Grand Emperor would turn to ashes. Flame Emperor, Wave Emperor, and even Immortal Emperor Wan Gu from the nine worlds were prime examples!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Run!” World Emperor instantly severed karma and the realms. There was no intention of getting the six wills back. He crossed the river of time and peeled off from space while carrying the other twelve Grand Emperors.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He came and left quickly, leaving behind the six wills that were locked. He was quite decisive enough in this endeavor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His real body didn’t come to kill Li Qiye, only to save the twelve emperors even if it meant risking a Heavenly Execution.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was due to seeing Li Qiye’s Death Record and understanding that the match was decided. Unless Li Qiye were to die from old age, his souls were destroyed, or the high heaven; nothing else could kill him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the three grand dao and the twelve laws gave Li Qiye a chance to retaliate. The guy wanted all forty wills, not just six, and perhaps even aimed to kill him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, World Emperor took action right away before disappearing from sight! With that, the Heavenly Execution also dissipated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye flatly muttered: “The old man has been hiding for too long so the moment he came out, an execution came. That was why dangerous…”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">World Emperor had reached the peak long ago with his twelve wills so he had to hide in the past. An emperor of his level had too great of a chance to bring out an execution upon sight. It was almost a certain thing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the tenth world, anyone who shouldered the Heaven’s Will had a certain probability of inciting a Heavenly Execution.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was much lower for anyone under six and especially less for one to two wills emperors. Six and above was much greater, needless to say about the twelve-will ones. Thus, most emperors would start to hide at the end of their generation. Some even did so much earlier.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.” The second law fused together completely with the six wills. It became resplendent as if it was full of life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a shame, the geezer is too careful with unbelievable skills or I would be triumphant, harvesting forty wills in one go. Then no need to trap more Grand Emperors in the future.” Li Qiye shook his head with a tinge of regrets.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was preparing for today long ago. Knowing that the upper echelon wouldn’t let him go and the ascension was their best chance to kill him, he waited for the ambush. His three grand dao and twelve laws required the Heaven’s Wills for gestation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He even wanted to light up all twelve at the same time. This would give him enough resources for the final battle. Alas, World Emperor was too careful and mighty so he only got six wills in the process.</span></p>
